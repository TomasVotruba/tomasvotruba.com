title: "How Dangerous is Your Nette Template&nbsp;Assign"
perex: |
    Symfony documentation contains a few ["best practices" that teach people to create bad code](https://matthiasnoback.nl/2014/10/unnecessary-contrapositions-in-the-new-symfony-best-practices/). It's important to talk about them so the framework can improve and thus its community can improve. Do you remember GitHub discussions about autowiring before it became part of Symfony?
    <br><br>
    Nette documentation is no different. **Today, we'll look at configuring templates and how to use them better and safer**.

## What is the Main Purpose of Template?

What should a template engine do? Render some content to an end-user. Sometimes, it can be a static page; sometimes, there can be parameters. But fundamentally, that's it. Anything else is just fancy syntax sugar.

Let's look at a simple template example:

```html
I'll give 10 Bitcoins to people in need
```

Hmm, maybe the number will change. Let's make a parameter out of it:

```php
$bitcoinCount = 10;
```

```html
<!-- templates/giveaway.latte -->
I'll give {$bitcoinCount} Bitcoins to people in need
```

That was easy!

<br>

Are you curious about how other frameworks handle simple rendering? Me too!

<br>

[**CakePHP 4**](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/controllers.html#rendering-a-view)

```php
public function giveaway()
{
    $this->set('bitcoinCount', 100);
    return $this->render('templates/giveaway');
}
```

<br>

[**Yii 2**](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-views#rendering-views)

```php
public function giveaway()
{
    return $this->render('giveaway', [
        'bitcoinCount' => 100,
    ]);
}
```

<br>

[**Laravel 8**](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/controllers#basic-controllers)

```php
public function giveaway()
{
    return view('giveaway', [
        'bitcoinCount' => 100
    ]);
}
```

<br>

[**Symfony 5**](https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#creating-templates)

```php
public function giveaway()
{
    return $this->render('templates/giveaway.twig', [
        'bitcoinCount' => 100
    ]);
}
```

<br>

And [**Nette 3.1**](https://doc.nette.org/en/3.1/components#toc-rendering)

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;
    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte');
}
```

<br>

What do they have in common?

- every approach is using some name or absolute path as **template identifier**
- the template identifier is passed **first argument of "render" method**

But how are parameters handled? There are 2 groups:

- parameter can be set **anywhere above** the "render" method
- parameters are passed **exactly once** into the "render" method

The 2nd approach is far better than 1st one. Could you guess **9 reasons why**?

## 1. Variable Override Bug

Why don't we use public properties? Because they can be overridden anywhere without us knowing:

```php
final class Product
{
    public $price;
}
```

We have at least setters that we can somehow monitor:

```php
final class Product
{
    private $price;

    public function changePrice($price)
    {
        $this->price = $price;
    }
}
```

You might be thinking - why would anyone make such a rookie mistake? I assure you, **this is one the most hated bug in legacy code**. Single variable change can take days or weeks to find out... if you have to go through 2 500 000 lines of code, you see for the first time.

Private property and change methods are still crappy though:

```php
$product = new Product();

$product->changePrice(100);

// 1000 lines bellow

$product->changePrice(10);
```

So after many years of tears learned to **use a constructor, where we require the values that cannot be changed**:

```php
final class Product
{
    public function __construct(
        private $price
    ) {
    }
}
```

How is this related to `$this->template`? The same way we can break `Product` price, we can break `$this->template` parameters:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

    // 1000 lines bellow

    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 10;

    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte');
}
```

Or more evil example:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

    $this->sendNotification();

    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte');
}

// 1000 lines bellow

private function sendNotification(): void
{
    // oh, someone needs to do little unrelated change here
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 10;
}
```

What is the `$bitcoinCount`? `10` or `100`? It depends on the `$this->template` override mechanism, I guess.

## 2. Call Me... Maybe

With property access like this, we can define parameters... just sometimes:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    if ($this->inGoodMood) {
        $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;
    }

    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte');
}
```

Quick quiz: **what is the `$bitcoinCount` value in the template?**

- `false`
- `null`
- nothing, use `isset()` to check if exists
- nothing, use `empty()` to check if exists

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 3. Unset or Nullable Variable?

This bug build on previous weakness. Let's say we have a [null-hell](https://afilina.com/null-hell) nullable return:

```php
private function getBitcoinCount(): ?int
{
    // ...
}
```

How can we differentiate between variable set to `null`...

```php
$this->template->bitcoinCount = $this->getBitcoinCount();
```

...and variable that is missing?

```php
if ($this->inGoodMood) {
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = $this->getBitcoinCount();
}
```

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 4. Forgotten Require Variable

The example above would also fail, because the `{$bitcoinCount}` is required in template:

```html
<!-- templates/giveaway.latte -->
I'll give {$bitcoinCount} Bitcoins to people in need
```

How can you **define what is required variable**? In objects and services, we have `__construct()` for that, but here?

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 5. Two Ways to do One Thing

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/two_thing_one.jpg" class="img-thumbnail mt-4 mb-2">

Let's say we manage to set variable once in the template. Many months later, a new developer learns about 2nd `render()` parameters and uses them:

```diff
 public function render(): void
 {
     $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

-    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte');
+    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte', [
+        'bitcoinCount' => 10
+    ]);
 }
```

What is the final template we'll see?

- A. `I'll give 100 Bitcoins to people in need`
- B. `I'll give 10 Bitcoins to people in need`

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 6. Read It!

As with any other public property, we can read it and modify it:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

    if ($this->template->bitcoinCount > 100) {
        $this->template->bitcoinCount += 10;
    }
}
```

Soon we're using `$this->template` for any variable operation.

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 7. Killing Known Types

We know that type of `100` is `int`, so do PHPStan, PHPStorm, and Rector. But once we set it to magical `$this->template`, everybody becomes blind:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

    // condition is always true... but who knows?
    if (is_int($this->template->bitcoinCount)) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## 8. Making Magic more Magical

With Nette 3.0, there has been an attempt to fix the magic with [typed template objects](https://blog.nette.org/en/latte-how-to-use-type-system). The intention to have a typed template is good, but it adds more magic to rendering.

The `$this->template` is not a service anymore, but a value object. That can hold parameters. And also render itself somehow. That's typical example of **[active record anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)**. Are you able to give birth yourself? **Not a way to go.**

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

There is a better way to have both **typed template** and **pass parameters just once**. I'll write about it soon - stay tuned.

## 9. Typos Everywhere

Could you guess, what will happen here?

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->bitcoinCount = 100;

    if ($this->template->bitcointCount > 10) {
        $this->template->bitcoinCount -= 10;
    }

    // ...
}
```

The condition is obviously a `true`, right?

Well, the second variable *bitcoin**t**Count* does not exists, so we're now `-10` bitcoints.

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-2x fa-times text-danger"></em>

## Back to Basics

There is one more surprise. How does [Latte documentation](https://latte.nette.org/en/guide#toc-installation-and-usage) look like? **It promotes the clear approach!**

```php
$latte = new Latte\Engine;

$latte->render('template.latte', [
    'items' => ['one', 'two', 'three']
]);
```

So why is every presenter and component using it wrong? Because Occam's razor - people **tend to pick the first solution they see and use it everywhere**.

## The Correct Way to Render Templates With Parameters

What if there is a way to avoid all 7 possible bugs above? Like we don't have enough bug potential in our code-bases.

I know you've already guessed it, but just to Google can find it too. The correct way to render parameters is to **pass them exactly once** as 2nd parameter of `render()` method:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte', [
        'bitcoinCount' => 10
    ]);
}
```

Do we work with a value above the render? **Use a variable** to separate templating system from business logic:

```php
public function render(): void
{
    $bitcoinCount = $this->getBitcoinCount();
    if ($bitcoinCount === null) {
        $bitcoinCount = self::MINIMUM_REQUIRED_AMOUNT;
    }

    $this->template->render(__DIR__ . '/templates/giveaway.latte', [
        'bitcoinCount' => $bitcoinCount,
    ]);
}
```

Do we need an optional parameter? **Such code smell** suggests our template architecture is wrong:

- Maybe there should be an extra component?
- Maybe the parameter should be required and have a value of `0`?

<br>

Do you have more magical objects like this one? Please get rid of them before they get rid of your sanity. Now you have nine reasons why :)

<br>

Happy coding!
