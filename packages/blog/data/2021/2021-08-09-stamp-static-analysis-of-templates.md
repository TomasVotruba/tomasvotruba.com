title: "STAMP: Static Analysis of Templates"
perex: |
    Today we have static analysis checking every line of our PHP code - with PHPStan, Psalm and PHPStorm. With php-parser and abstract syntax tree, we can do **instant changes across hundreds of files** in second. With precision of human hair.
    <br><br>
    With all this power and utils having our back, we can see the next low hanging fruit that needs our attention - templates.

Are you hungry? I hope so. Let's cook some dinner for our family, shall we?

What are we having? Let's say we have a template with title of the meal for tonight:

```html
<!-- TWIG syntax -->
{{ meal.title }}

<!-- Latte syntax -->
{$meal->getTitle()}
```

The meal is very simple object:

```php
namespace App;

final class Meal
{
    public function getTitle(): string
    {
        return 'Potato Salad and Schnitzel';
    }

    // ...
}
```

Pretty clear, right?

## Renamed a Method

Now, something feels itchy about this object. The name of `getTitle()` method. When we first created this `App\Meal` class, we were probably thinking more about *post* or *news*. There it makes more sense.

In this case, maybe the *name* would be better choice. Do you agree? Let's rename it.

We rename it using PHPStorm and "Rename Method" action:

```diff
 namespace App;

 final class Meal
 {
-    public function getTitle(): string
+    public function getName(): string
     {
         return 'Potato Salad and Schnitzel';
     }

     // ...
 }
```

Now it feels better to read the code. We'll reload webpage to show our changes to our family...

<br>

...and it crashes with *Error 500*.

## We Forgot Something, What Was it?... Kevin!

We missed one important spot. PHPStorm is an excellent tool to handle PHP code. But it's PHPStorm, not *TemplateStorm*, so it missed rename in the template:

```html
<!-- TWIG syntax -->
{{ meal.title }}

<!-- Latte syntax -->
{$meal->getTitle()}
```

Once we see the error, we know what to do to make it go away:

```diff
 <!-- TWIG syntax -->
-{{ meal.title }}
+{{ meal.name }}

 <!-- Latte syntax -->
-{$meal->getTitle()}
+{$meal->getName()}
```

That's it! We refresh the website and it works as before:

```html
Potato Salad and Schnitzel
```

## Manual Fix Does not Scale

The focused and simple use case above might work in a demo article like this one, but in real projects, it's quite rare to see a template with 1 line of code.

We do such renames in projects that make money. There might be some tests, but not every single template render path is tested. We can't afford to wait for "user testing" and error 500 in our logs.

Let's see what would happen in PHP-only world. We can do method rename either manually, with PHPStorm or Rector. What happens if we forget single spot?

```php
$meal = new Meal();
echo $meal->getTitle();
```

The pull-request CI pipeline fails red with message:

```bash
Calling unknown method "getTitle" on "App\Meal" object
```

Yes, PHPStan protects us. If such bug would get into the code, it would be really stupid.

Should we treat templates with lower expectations? No!
**The same rules that apply for our PHP code, must apply for templates as well.**

## Starting Post Series

There are couple of interesting topics in area of static analysis in templates.  I consider them extremely joyful and worth sharing with you. **It's a brand new topic, so I would like to invite you to shape the future of it**.

What do you think about it? Let me know in comments bellow or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/votrubat).

Happy coding!
