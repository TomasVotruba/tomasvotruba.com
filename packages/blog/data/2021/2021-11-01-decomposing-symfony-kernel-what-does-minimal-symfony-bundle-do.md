title: "Decomposing Symfony Kernel: What does Minimal Symfony Bundle Do"
perex: |
    In the previous post, we looked at [When Symfony Http Kernel is a Too Big Hammer to Use](/blog/when-symfony-http-kernel-is-too-big-hammer-to-use). We talked about the enormous content this package provides, but we don't need it.
    <br><br>
    Today we'll have a little self-reflecting pause in the middle of the 4-post journey. We'll look at the main glue in Symfony Kernel - the Bundle. **Can we find a way to decompose it and use it without Kernel?**

In the previous post, we described the problem: the Symfony Kernel requires a lot of http-related code **that we don't need in command line applications**. We still have to maintain it, require-dev dependencies in production, and handle their downgrade.

When a pandemic hit our world in 2020, we didn't think about our studies, where we would go for a vacation, or what car we'd buy. We care about our family, what we eat for dinner, and where we can buy everyday life essentials. When we find ourselves in times of trouble, we try to look at bare essentials.

## What are the Kernel Essentials?

How can we use this approach in the "my application kernel is way too big" situation?

<br>

**What do we need from Kernel?**
* To build our dependency injection container from provided PHP config.

<br>

**How can Kernel do that?**
* It takes the main config, few bundles, and loads them together.

<br>

**What is the bundle class doing?**
* It collects one PHP config, sometimes Extension or compiler passes, and passes it to Kernel to process further.

<br>

**Which do we need from those 3?**
* The config, because it defines service autodiscovery, parameters, and sometimes manual arguments.
* The Extension primarily refers to the config, so we don't need that.
* We need compiler passes because they decorate service definitions and interact with each other.

<br>

## 1. The Bundle

Let's look at one of the Symplify bundles to demonstrate actual code. This is `AstralBundle`, which allows other kernels to register `symplify/astral` service and use them:

```php
namespace Symplify\Astral\Bundle;

use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Bundle\Bundle;
use Symplify\Astral\DependencyInjection\Extension\AstralExtension;

final class AstralBundle extends Bundle
{
    protected function createContainerExtension(): AstralExtension
    {
        return new AstralExtension();
    }
}
```

### 2. The Extension

The Bundle class contains `createContainerExtension()` that further creates `AstralExtension`. What is that one doing?

```php
namespace Symplify\Astral\DependencyInjection\Extension;

use Symfony\Component\Config\FileLocator;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Extension\Extension;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\PhpFileLoader;

final class AstralExtension extends Extension
{
    public function load(array $configs, ContainerBuilder $containerBuilder): void
    {
        $phpFileLoader = new PhpFileLoader(
            $containerBuilder,
            new FileLocator(__DIR__ . '/../../config')
        );

        $phpFileLoader->load('config.php');
    }
}
```

<br>

It seems it loads the `../../config/config.php`. There we define services and parameters.

So we need:
* a `*Bundle` class,
* an `*Extension` class,
* and register the `*Bundle` class in `*Kernel.php` in the `registerBundles()` method.

```php
$fileLoader->load(__DIR__ . '/../../config.php');
```

## Where Else can we Load Configs?

Does this look familiar? There are at least 2 places that handle the same operation. Nothing special, and they're pretty standard - you can see both in the code of this website.

One of them is `MicroKernelTrait::configureContainer()` method:

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Kernel\MicroKernelTrait;
use Symfony\Component\Config\Loader\LoaderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel;

final class TomasVotrubaKernel extends Kernel
{
    use MicroKernelTrait;

    protected function configureContainer(
        ContainerBuilder $containerBuilder,
        LoaderInterface $loader
    ): void {
        $loader->load(__DIR__ . '/../../vendor/symplify/astral/config/config.php');
    }
}
```

<br>

The other is any `config/config.php` that we already load in our Kernel:

```php
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;

return function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $containerConfigurator->import(
        __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/symplify/astral/config/config.php'
    );
};
```

As you can see, we can replace Bundle + Extension classes with single-line import either in Kernel or in `config.php`. That's **2 classes and one method we don't have to worry about anymore**.

<br>

~~ Extension ~~ is gone, and we can import config elsewhere. What about the compiler passes? We can [add them in the Kernel](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/compiler_passes.html) in `build()` method:

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Kernel\MicroKernelTrait;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel as BaseKernel;

class Kernel extends BaseKernel
{
    use MicroKernelTrait;

    protected function build(ContainerBuilder $containerBuilder): void
    {
        $containerBuilder->addCompilerPass(new SomeCompilerPass());
    }
}
```

We've managed to tidy up the Kernel a bit. With less code to work with, we might see the solution more easily... or **have we just moved the same problem with somewhere else**?

We'll see about that next time.

<br>

Happy coding!
