    Do you have time to read a book every now and then after work? Yes? Get [Rector - The Power of Automated Refactoring](/book/the-power-of-automated-refactoring) and practice AST katas daily.

    But not everyone has such a passion for technology, and yet want to get the work done with as less mistakes as possible. **Learning a new technology alone is hard.** There is too much edge-case to think about on every level of technology we use.

I believe the code automation has been changing the world as we know it. From automated deploys, through coding with CI, to self-repairing systems and GitHub Co-Pilot working for you.

If you work with software, it's worth learning. Do you believe it too, but have **only 1 spare day to spend on learning**?

<br>

**For you and your team, I've prepared 3 practical trainings**. Each focuses on specific area of automation that helps you automate your daily work:


## 1. Rector Ownage

Do you want to run Rector on your project and get the most out of it? First steps with AST are the hardest. Goal of this training is to fast forward you 3 months of self-taught know-how in a couple of days.

## 2. PHPStan Guru

Do you use PHPStan everyday? Would you like to learn use more rules that would help you find bugs faster?

## 3. Bulletproof CI

Would you like to make your easy learn from? Would you like to shorten code-reviews to fraction and speedup on-boarding? Do you want to avoid repeating bugs that are not part of tests?
