title: "Introducing Light Kernel for Symfony&nbsp;Console&nbsp;Apps"
perex: |
    In the first post of this miniseries, we looked on [Symfony HttpKernel package](/blog/when-symfony-http-kernel-is-too-big-hammer-to-use) with critical eye on how it makes projects way too heavy.
    <br><br>
    In the second post, we [looked at a bundles](/blog/decomposing-symfony-kernel-what-does-minimal-symfony-bundle-do) from very raw point of view.
    <br><br>
    In spirit of [thesis, antithesis and synthesis](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-8265-8_200183) philosophy, we'll try to combine both parts. We'll find a solution to original question: **How can we run Kernel in Symfony Console Apps without http burdens?**
