title: "Never Forget Symfony Config Options Again"
perex: |
    Have you switched your Symfony configs from **stringy YAML to typed PHP**? If not, [do it now](/blog/2020/07/27/how-to-switch-from-yaml-xml-configs-to-php-today-with-migrify/). Here is [at least 10 reasons why](/blog/2020/07/16/10-cool-features-you-get-after-switching-from-yaml-to-php-configs/).
    Only then you'll start to notice a code smell that was there in every YAML configs.
    <br><br>
    Just now, the code smell is too smelly to ignore.

Let's look at the Symfony FrameworkBundle extension configuration. Where can we configure them? In `config/packages` directory.

## 1. Poor YAML

This is how it looks in YAML:

What is the name of the key? Secret, secrets...? We don't know, and we only copy-paste from Symfony Documentation.

## 2. Plain PHP

So how does this [memory-lock](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2018/08/27/why-and-how-to-avoid-the-memory-lock/) change with PHP?

No, we can **the code smell** is banging us to our eyes:

- In YAML, we're used to be very active because we have to type everything manually and correctly. One extra space or indent, and the whole file will crash.
- In PHP, we're used to IDE take care of us. When we start typing "Ent...", we expect the IDE to autocomplete `EntityManagerInterface` and add use import at the top of the file.

What is the code smell in a config? We don't have to autocomplete for the option name. **The option names are always the same**, one might say "constant," and can be found in [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html):

But I don't want to memory 50 words per Symfony config. I want to code ambitious Rector rules that will remove "legacy" from our vocabulary. If only there was something like IDE but for Symfony configs...

## 3. Smart PHP with Amnesia

Instead of typing strings from the back of your memory, make use of `Symplify\Amnesia\ValueObject\Symfony\Extension\FrameworkExtension` constants.

There is constant class for `TwigExtension`:

<br>

Also for Doctrine - `DoctrineExtension`, with `ORM` and `DBAL` classes:

Pretty cool, right? We don't have to care about string and documentation reference because **all configuration options are defined in the place we need them**. [Just in time](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/).

Don't forget to add [Amnesia](https://github.com/symplify/amnesia) to your project:

```bash
compose require symplify/amnesia
```

And that's it!

Happy coding!
