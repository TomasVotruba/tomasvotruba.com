title: "Astral - The Best Kit for php-parser AST Developers"
perex: |
    Working with php-parser abstract syntax tree is fun. You can modify [any node](https://github.com/rectorphp/php-parser-nodes-docs#node-overview) in the tree, change class method names or add new arguments.
    <br><br>
    Such work requires **abstract and [deeply focused thinking](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2018/09/13/your-brain-is-your-garden/)**. But sometimes all we need as to get a method call name or constant value. That's completely different detailed nitpicking boring thinking...
    <br><br>
    That's where **Astral package helps**.
