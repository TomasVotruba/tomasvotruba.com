title: "How to Migrate Spaghetti to 304&nbsp;Symfony 5 Controllers Over Weekend"
perex: |
    During Easter weekend, usually, people take a break and have a rest. Instead, we used these 4 days of *holiday* to migrate the 304-controller application. At least that was the goal on Friday.
    <br><br>
    Me in my colleague in the migrated project accepted the challenge. We got into many minds and code-traps. We'd like to share this experience with you and **inspire those who are still stuck on non-MVC code** and think it might take weeks or even months to switch to a framework.

## What is the Goal?

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-times text-danger"></em> **We didn't want a  hybrid** with static dependency injection container, legacy controller, request separation for new website and for old website. It only creates more legacy code than in the beginning.

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-star-half text-warning"></em> **We were ok with** keeping original business logic code untouched. We will handle spaghetti decoupling to Controller and Twig in the next phase. This was just a 1st step of many.

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-check text-success"></em> **We wanted** to be able to use Symfony dependency injection, Twig templates, Controller rendering, Symfony Security, Events, Repository, connection to database, `.env`, Flex, Bundles, YAML configs, [local packages](/blog/2020/02/17/local-packages-3-years-later/).

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-check text-success"></em> **We wanted automate** everything that is possible to automate.

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-check text-success"></em> **We wanted to run** on Symfony 5.0 and PHP 7.4.

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-check text-success"></em> **We wanted to write** any future code as if in any other Symfony application without going back.

<br>

Well, we wanted a full-stack framework, as you can find in [symfony/demo](https://github.com/symfony/demo).

Isn't that too much for one weekend? üòÇ

Honestly, I'm just **[freaking lazy](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful)** to do work for a longer time than a few days (in a row).

## The Application in The Start

So how does the application look like?

[Symfony documentation describes](https://symfony.com/doc/current/controller.html) **a controller** as *a PHP function you create that reads information from the Request object and creates and returns a Response object*. In our case, the "Request object" was an entry URL, "Response object" was spaghetti rendered as `echo "string";`.

Saying that the application had:

- 304 "controllers"
- templating done directly in the file with inlined PHP in HTML
- base *layout* done with `include "header.php";`
- 2 good old HTML frames, one for the menu - the other for the rest of application

<br>

Typical *controller* looked like this:

```php
<?php
// contact.php

include 'header.php';

$content = get_data_from_database();

// 500 lines of spaghetti code

echo $content;
```

## First: Make a Plan

The migration pull-request itself is just **half of the work**. First, we had to have [coding standards, PSR-4 autoloading, PHPStan on level 8](/blog/2019/12/16/8-steps-you-can-make-before-huge-upgrade-to-make-it-faster-cheaper-and-more-stable/) etc. When I say PHPStan on level 8, we skipped those errors with 50+ cases.

The next half is [to have a full team on board](/blog/2019/08/26/how-we-migrated-54-357-lines-of-code-nette-to-symfony-in-2-people-under-80-hours/) and have **a clear plan**.

## PHP Template in Symfony 5?

We had a goal, so what's the plan? First, we wanted to switch PHP + HTML to controllers. Maybe we could use something like [PHP templates](https://symfony.com/doc/4.4/templating/PHP.html) + render them with a controller?

The idea is great, except **PHP templates were deprecated** in Symfony 4 and **removed** in Symfony 5:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2020/symfonize_php_template_nope.png" class="img-thumbnail mt-3 mb-3">

## Raw Symfony Application

Hm, so what now? If it too huge, take something smaller. First, we need to actually have a Symfony project:

- remove `vendor`
- remove `composer.lock`

- install Symfony dependencies:

```bash
composer require symfony/asset symfony/cache symfony/console symfony/dotenv \
    symfony/flex symfony/framework-bundle symfony/http-foundation symfony/http-kernel \
    symfony/twig-bridge symfony/twig-bundle \
    symplify/autowire-array-parameter \
    symplify/package-builder twig/twig doctrine/cache symfony/security-core \
    symfony/security-bundle symfony/security-csrf doctrine/orm doctrine/doctrine-bundle \
    doctrine/annotations doctrine/common doctrine/dbal symfony/error-handler symfony/form
```

- don't forget `dev` too:

```bash
composer require --dev symfony/maker-bundle symfony/web-profiler-bundle
```

Few fixes of bundles installation that Flex missed, adding database credential to `.env.local` file to login into the database, and we're ready to continue **with an uplifted spirit of success**.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2020/symfonize_raw_run.png" class="img-thumbnail mt-3 mb-3">

Soon to be **demolished again by new problems** we never faced before... Let's look at the controllers.

<br>

We wanted to use [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) to convert all the files to classic Symfony controllers.

The simple rule is: `<filename>.php`

- route name: `filename`
- route path: `filename`

## What Will Be Inside Controller?

Just simply copy-paste the spaghetti code first, maybe that will be enough:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

final class ContactController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @Route(path="contact", name="contact")
     */
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        $content = get_data_from_database();
        // 500 lines of spaghetti code

        // this won't work, we need to return Response object :/
        echo $content;
    }
}
```

If the content would be echoed **just once**, we could use:

```php
$content = get_data_from_database();
// 500 lines of spaghetti code

return new \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response($content);
```

But there is `echo` all over the place - like **50 times in those 500 lines of spaghetti code**.

<br>

Then we remembered, there are `ob_*` functions **that collect echoed content, but don't show it**. If we wrap the spaghetti and get content with `ob_get_contents()` in the end, it might work.

```php
ob_start();

// 500 lines of spaghetti code

$content = (string) ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();
return new \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response($content);
```

<br>

4 hours of writing a Rector rule for the migration and voil√° - we had **304 new Symfony controllers**:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

final class ContactController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @Route(path="contact", name="contact")
     */
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        ob_start();

        $content = get_data_from_database();
        // 500 lines of spaghetti code

        $content = (string) ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        return new Response($content);
    }
}
```

That wasn't that hard. Let's run the website to enjoy the fruits of Eden:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2020/symfonize_first_crash.png" class="img-thumbnail mt-3 mb-3">

Hm, maybe we should **update all the links from `contact.php` to `contact` routes** in every PHP file too. Also, all 304 links to all controller we just converted.

## How to get Base Template into Templates?

Now when you entered `https://localhost:8000/contact`, you saw the raw page. From cool Symfony controller, but still a raw page. **We wanted to use Twig templates**, so we could enjoy filters, helpers, global variables, assets, etc.

<br>

This was our goal:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

final class ContactController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @Route(path="contact", name="contact")
     */
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        return $this->render('controller/contact.twig');
    }
}
```

In the end, that `__invoke` method is actually in every controller **in this exact format**. But we still **miss one piece of the puzzle**.

We also wanted to use normal `base.twig`, as we're used to in every MVC project:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
      {# some assets #}
   </head>
   <body>
      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-4">
            {% include "_snippet/menu.twig" %}
         </div>
         <div class="col-8">
              {% block main %}
              {% endblock %}
           </div>
       </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

What's inside the `controller/contact.twig`?

```twig
{% extends "base.twig" %}

{% block main %}
    PHP? Spaghetti? Magic?
{% endblock %}
```

How would **you solve it**? If you find a better way, let us know in the comments.

**Remember**: no PHP in Twig templates and no going back to Symfony 4.

<br>
<br>
<br>

We came up with this trick:

```twig
{% extends "base.twig" %}

{% block main %}
    {{ render(controller('App\\Controller\\ContractController::content')) }}
{% endblock %}
```

In each controller there will be not only the `__invoke()` method, but also the `content` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

final class ContactController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @Route(path="contact", name="contact")
     */
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        return $this->render('controller/contact.twig');
    }

    /**
     * @Route(path="contact_content", name="contact_content")
     */
    public function content(): Response
    {
        ob_start();

        $content = get_data_from_database();
        // 500 lines of spaghetti code

        $content = (string) ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        return new Response($content);
    }
}
```

With this approach, we have all we wanted:

<em class="fas fa-fw mt-4 fa-check text-success"></em> **We can to write** any future code as if in any other Symfony application without going back.

<br>

To add chery on top, we added Symfony login:

And that's it!

### Blind Paths to Avoid

- don't go to Symfony 5.1-dev, stay with **stable Symfony 5.0** - the install of dev packages is very slow both on CI and locally
- don't go to Symfony 4 just to use PHP templates; it's just postponing the problem + adding more legacy code
- don't rush to PHP 7.4 before migration is finished, for the migration start **PHP 7.2** is good enough (ECS and Rector need it as minimal version)

### Caveats

- do [8 Steps You Can Make Before Huge Upgrade to Make it Faster, Cheaper and More Stable](/blog/2019/12/16/8-steps-you-can-make-before-huge-upgrade-to-make-it-faster-cheaper-and-more-stable/) first
- **have a strict deadline** - our original plan was the end of May, but when Easter came, we couldn't resist
- **don't fall in the bait of manual refactoring** of that one thing in the code you don't like - **stay focused on the migration** and improve code when the 1st step is finished and merged
- **have a buddy**, that helps you psychically when you're stuck - without a friend, this might turn into a nightmare of being stuck in circles; even only talking about the problem helps - it's better if it's somebody outside your normal work (consultant, old collegaue), so they're not stuck in your legacy project mindset
- **be ok with broken code** for a while, it's normal even with small changes
- don't deploy code to the production, merge the PR as soon as possible, but test the application on a separate server at least for a week

## The Final Plan

- install Symfony dependencies
- add `bin/console`, `src/AppKernel.php` and `public/index.php` files
- run base Symfony homepage
- add credentials to `.env.local` and login to database
- prepare migration rule to Symfony controllers and let Rector
    - migrate controllers
    - create `*` templates
    - create `*_content.twig` templates
- let Rector dump changed files into `old_controller_files.json`
- load data from `old_controller_files.json` and
    - use `preg_replace` in all files to replace `contact.php` to `contact`, files names to routes
    - delete old files
- delete `old_controller_files.json`

<br>

We made many mistakes, took many blind paths, so you don't have to (you can take new blind paths), but in the end, we made it from Friday till Monday - **in 4 days**:

**Are you still on a legacy project?** What's your excuse that prevents your change for better?

Happy coding!
