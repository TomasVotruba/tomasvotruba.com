perex: |
    I started to write this post as follow up for [clean and sustainable code](/blog/2019/12/16/8-steps-you-can-make-before-huge-upgrade-to-make-it-faster-cheaper-and-more-stable/) post. In the middle of writing, I've realized I have this approach to ever repository I meet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Imagine it like a working desk. But not your usual stable place where you work every day. **Instead, you are assigned to a new desk of a former employee, who worked in the company for 5 years and as a bonus - it was the CTO**. For you, it's a mess.
    <br>

    What is the first thing we do? We'll **prepare it for hard work**.

I get to 2-3 new projects/week and during the last couple of years I've noticed **I repeat the same preparing process before work itself**. It makes me much more effective and creates a very intuitive environment to work in.

## 1. Set 1 Spacing Rule

Without this file, every file has a different number of spaces, tabs, line-endings... and everything else we can't see.

Well, until you have errors like:

- *YAML syntax error*
- *Mix of tabs and spaces*

Or *creatively* structured code like:

```php
<?php

class SomeClass
{
public function someMethod()
{
}
}
```

We don't need these problems, it's the computers' job.

**This takes 1 minute to set up and commit**:

```yaml
# .editorconfig
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

<div class="text-center">
    <em class="fas fa-4x fa-check text-success margin-auto"></em>
</div>

<br>

## 2. Make Sure vendor is in `vendor`

The easier miss-location, that works as default on some operation systems, is this:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "vendor-dir": "Vendor"
    }
}
```

It might be a great feeling to be creative for various reasons, but **most PHP tools are not ready for this**, e.g. PHPStan and Rector fail here.

Unless there is some supercritical issue, I always make it a standard way:

```diff
-{
-    "config": {
-        "vendor-dir": "Vendor"
-    }
-}
```

<div class="text-center">
    <em class="fas fa-4x fa-check text-success margin-auto"></em>
</div>

<br>

## 3. Move Code to `/src`

In times old so I can't remember, code was located randomly. Then PSR-0 came, then PSR-4. [Many tools depend on PSR-4](/blog/2019/12/16/8-steps-you-can-make-before-huge-upgrade-to-make-it-faster-cheaper-and-more-stable/#1-psr-4-standard), so another standard naturally came to my toolset.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-3">
    Keep source code in <code>/src</code>.
</blockquote>

That means only source code needed for production, so:

- **no migrations**
- **no fixtures**
- **no test helpers**
- **no coding standard utils**
- **no Rector utils**
- **no templates**
- **no translations**
- **no configs**
- **no bin files**
- **no helpers bash scripts**
- **no cool git repository tricks**

Once we rule in place know that every command, that works with PHP code will get only one argument: `src`

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs c src
vendor/bin/phpstan a src
vendor/bin/rector p src
```

<div class="text-center">
    <em class="fas fa-4x fa-check text-success margin-auto"></em>
</div>

<br>

## 4. Directory Name = Directory Content

Saying the one above, I apply the same for other content:

- binary files? ‚Üí `bin`
- files used in continues integration? ‚Üí `ci`
- configs? ‚Üí `configs`
- templates? ‚Üí `templates`
- translations? ‚Üí `translations`
- database migrations? ‚Üí `migration`

...and so on.

You may know it as:

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-3">
    1 level architecture.
</blockquote>

It's very intuitive to use, based on UX, DX and well... **human brain. We tend to choose simpler solutions over complex ones**. Often it leads to crappy application design.

I have a special case for Rector, coding standards, PHPStan rules, utils that helps in development, but aren't part of the project itself ‚Üí `utils/<project>/src`

<div class="text-center">
    <em class="fas fa-4x fa-check text-success margin-auto"></em>
</div>

## 5. `fs`, `ps`, `pu`... 2 Chars Shortcuts for Tools that Help Me

```bash
fs
ps
pu
```

6 characters, even "characters" has 10 characters.

I can't imagine to code without them. What are they?

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src tests --fix
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src tests
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Well, now you know [I use aliases in my bash](/blog/2019/11/25/the-single-best-skill-to-master-command-line/). It's **the ultimate *skill***, because your brain gets much more space to think.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-5">
    "But every project has different directories.<br>
    Do you use some uber hack alias for every single project?"
</blockquote>

That's right, in one project it is:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src tests --fix
```

in another it is:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src packages tests --fix
```

Well, this how my bash aliases look like:

```bash
alias fs="composer fix-cs"
alias ps="composer phpstan"
alias pu="vendor/bin/phpunit"
```

**I never change them**. So where is the dynamic part?

Have you heard of [composer scripts](https://blog.martinhujer.cz/have-you-tried-composer-scripts)?

In every project I came to, I set up dev dependencies and scripts first:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "symplify/easy-coding-standard": "^7.1",
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^0.12",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^8.5"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "fix-cs": "vendor/bin/ecs check bin src tests --fix --ansi",
        "phpstan": "vendor/bin/phpstan analyse bin src tests --ansi --error-format symplify"
    }
}
```

That way I can modify directories right in `composer.json`.

So **when I do any change in the code**:

- I open 3 terminals in PHPStorm console
- I run 3 scripts in parallel = **it's faster and I can focus better on 1 tool**
- I know what came wrong and re-run only the broken part

```bash
fs
ps
pu
```

As a side benefit, continuous integration is easier to set up and maintain:

```yaml
# travis.yml
jobs:
    include:
        -
            stage: test
            name: ECS
            script:
                - composer check-cs

        -
            name: PHPStan
            script:
                - composer phpstan
```

Is there one new directory `utils` to check? Just update `composer.json`:

```diff
 {
     "require-dev": {
         "symplify/easy-coding-standard": "^7.1",
         "phpstan/phpstan": "^0.12",
         "phpunit/phpunit": "^8.5"
     },
     "scripts": {
-        "fix-cs": "vendor/bin/ecs check bin src tests --fix --ansi",
+        "fix-cs": "vendor/bin/ecs check bin src tests utils --fix --ansi",
-        "phpstan": "vendor/bin/phpstan analyse bin src tests --ansi --error-format symplify"
+        "phpstan": "vendor/bin/phpstan analyse bin src tests utils --ansi --error-format symplify"
    }
}
```

This way I also see, **what directories contain PHP code, that needs to be checked**.

<div class="text-center">
    <em class="fas fa-4x fa-check text-success margin-auto"></em>
</div>
