## What is Monorepo?

A repository **that contains multiple packages** or projects. Those projects can, but **don't have to be related**. Most famous monorepo pioneers are Google, Facebook and Twitter.

The most famous monorepos in PHP are Symfony, Laravel, Symplify, Sylius, Yii2 or Shopsys.

## Monorepo vs. Multirepo

### Single-repo or split-repo?

Monorepo is split into many single-repos, e.g. [Symfony/Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony) is split into [Symfony/Console](https://github.com/symfony/console), [Symfony/Validator](https://github.com/symfony/validator) etc. Each single-repo repository is read-only. You can change its code via pull-request to the monorepo.

### Many-repo

The other approach to manage multiple repositories. 1 package = 1 own repository. Each package has it's own development, tagging and even maintainers. E.g. [Doctrine 2](https://github.com/doctrine) or [Nette 2](https://github.com/nette).

### Monolith

Monolith ‚â† monorepo. Monolith is huge amount of coupled code of 1 application that is hell to maintain.
