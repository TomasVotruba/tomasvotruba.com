## From First Excitement Rush to Heavy Burden of Responsibility

[KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors) development was stuck since 2015. There were 10+ opened PRs to use interfaces over traits (to give classes clear contract), bug-fix PRs, and design improvements.

When I got a message from KnpLabs with an offer to maintain, I was super happy to say ["hell, yeah"](https://sivers.org/hellyeah). An excitement rush went through my veins. I could saw all the huge refactoring for better and how it helps the whole PHP community to move another step forward.

A moment later, when I realized what happened and how quickly, I started to be scared. The repository looked like a massive chunk of code that will need many design changes,  back compatibility breaks, etc. **All the responsibility started to fall on my shoulders, and it was heavy**.

I took it as challenge and started to [climb mountain](/blog/2018/04/30/programming-climbing-a-huge-mountain/), without knowing if or how this will end-up.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    There were only 2 options:<br>finished tagged version 2 or burn-out in the process.
</blockquote>

I took the risk.

## What Can We Do in 3 Weeks?

- **39 merged pull-requests**
- **93 closed issues**
- **5 alpha/beta tag releases**
- full support of Symfony 4.4 and 5

## What is new in Doctrine Behaviors 2.0?

All right, you get it. There were lots changes, but what exactly?

Let's start with the *sad part*.


### 3 Removed Behaviors

Tests did not cover some behaviors, nor described in README. When you look at them closely and write a test for them, you'll see **they never worked** or worked accidentally. I've cross-references these features with [gedmo/doctrine-extensions](https://packagist.org/packages/gedmo/doctrine-extensions) and saw DoctrineBehaviors is the only package that has them, resp. pretend to have them.

<br>

**Saying that these 3 behaviors were dropped:**

[Sortable](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/473)
- it only updated all values to `1`, completely broken

[Geocodable](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/467)
- it only worked on PostgreSQL with a specific function
- has a conflict with km/miles
- method API was very limited to a few narrow cases

[Filterable](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/463)
- overcomplicated API 4 required methods for single simple filter
- basically `findBy*()` magic on steroids, better use explicit non-magic methods with clear naming

**It is recommended to implement them yourself that suite your specific needs**.

<br>

Now that the sad part is behind us let's look at new features.


### From Trait to Interface

This work was initiated **by [bocharsky-bw](https://github.com/bocharsky-bw) and [@lemoinem](https://github.com/lemoinem)** back in 2016. Thank you both for clear PRs, it was quite easy for me to see changes and apply them to new and drastically different code [in this single PR](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/442).

**The idea is simple**: instead of traits that are problematic to detect by `instanceof` or `is_a()`, use interface for method and class contract.

<br>

What does it mean? This is *trait-first* approach:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampableTrait;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    use TimestampableTrait;
}
```

You use traits, so you don't have to create properties (`$createdBy` and `$updatedBy` in this case) manually. There are also 2 split traits for methods and properties, so the code above equals:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampablePropertiesTrait;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Timestampable\TimestampableMethodsTrait;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    use TimestampablePropertiesTrait;
    use TimestampableMethodsTrait;
}
```

But what happens if you remove trait and want to override methods?

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
}
```

Well, there is no contract by an interface, so we have no idea to fix this, we introduced interfaces:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TimestampableInterface;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product implements TimestampableInterface
{
}
```

Now PHPStorm tells you what methods it needs. You can use your code or a trait to cover them.

It also easy to detect an object that uses this behavior, which significantly improved performance and architecture at the same time:

```php
use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TimestampableInterface;

// object
$isTimestampableEntity = $entity instanceof TimestampableInterface;

// string class name
$isTimestampableEntity = is_a($entityClass, TimestampableInterface::class, true);
```

### Translation now needs Id

All the behaviors didn't add any id properties. Except for translation, where the id was added with this ugly magic method (mind the `@deprecated` note):

<img src="/assets/images/posts/doc_beha_id_magic.png" class="img-thumbnail">

The [inconsistency](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/issues/154) [was](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/issues/415) [problematic](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/158). In short: it was buggy and hard to use your id property because DoctrineBehaviors tried to *guess* what id you probably want.

The fix was suggested [early 2019](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/421), but the final fix was [merged in 2020](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/480/files).

What does it mean for your entities? **You need to add their own id**:

```diff
 <?php

 namespace App\Entity;

 use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Contract\Entity\TranslatableInterface;
 use Knp\DoctrineBehaviors\Model\Translatable\TranslatableTrait;

 /**
  * @ORM\Entity
  */
 class TranslatableEntityTranslation implements TranslationInterface
 {
     use TranslationTrait;

+    /**
+     * @ORM\Id
+     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
+     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
+     * @var int
+     */
+    private $id;
```

### Scalar Types

Scalar types make bugs more comfortable to discover, e.g., when a subscriber is broken, and it does not add value, return null will result in a fatal error.

That's why all the traits have scalar param and return types:

```diff
 trait TimestampableMethodsTrait
 {
-    /**
-     * @return DateTimeInterface
-     */
-    public function getCreatedAt()
+    public function getCreatedAt(): DateTimeInterface
     {
         return $this->createdAt;
     }
 }
```

Migration path for these types will be provided based on feedback, so **in case you override these methods manually, you won't have to complete the types**.

### Code Quality Changes

Feature improvements are essential. But to make them fast and stable, the [**code quality has the same importance**](/blog/2019/12/23/5-things-i-improve-when-i-get-to-new-repository/).

</blockquote>

How has been code quality improved?

- [ECS was added with PSR-12 coding standard check](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/435/files)
- [`CHANGELOG.md` is fully generated](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/470)
- [tests now respect PSR-4](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/commit/3b17cdf656b5f904c4222c559d78bbd17217881a)
- [Rector CI now checks dead code, code quality and Nette\Utils](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/445)
- [PHPStan now checks the static analysis](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/pull/436)


## Community Driven

Without the PHP community, packages are just chunks of code. Community around the package, city, or a meetup group is what makes it specials, gives it power and motivation to grow.

**I'd love to thank [@laurentHCM](https://github.com/laurentHCM) and [@nicolashachet](https://github.com/nicolashachet)** for the testing process of version 2 and instant migration with Rector. For their patience to report issues, test new Rector rules, and trying to solve all the packages conflicts desperately.

You gave me **the motivation** that helped me to overcome difficult moments when I got lost in the code.

## How to Migrate From version 1 to 2?

What is the biggest problem of any significant refactoring? The backward compatibility (*BC*) breaks:

- Class rename?
- Trait renamed?
- Return type added?
- Param type added?

**Roughly over 80-120 BC breaking changes** were performed between versions 1 and 2.

Imagine you have 20 such entities in your code, using 4 behavior traits, and now you have to:

- complete interfaces
- complete param types
- complete return types
- rename traits
- add an id to every translation entity

** I'd be angry at any project, who would do such change, without providing one-click upgrade path**.

<br>

That's why during such BC breaking changes **I've prepared [instant upgrade Rector set](https://github.com/KnpLabs/DoctrineBehaviors/blob/master/upgrade/rector/doctrine-behaviors-20.yaml) you can run on your code**:

```yaml
composer require rector/rector --dev
vendor/bin/rector process src --config vendor/knplabs/doctrine-behaviors/upgrade/rector/doctrine-behaviors-20.yaml
```

Single command turns to upgrade from 1 to 2 from days to few dozens of minutes.

## How does it Compare to Gedmo/Stof?

Are you a stof/gedmo user? Then you're familiar [with Symfony 5 issues](https://github.com/stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle/issues) around it. Don't worry. The KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors 2 was developed bearing you in mind.

KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors don't support softdeletable and non-materialized tree path *yet*, but the rest of the features are covered.

### How do you Migrate from Gedmo/Stof to KnpLabs\DoctrineBehaviors?

Read [Migrate Gedmo to KnpLabs](/blog/2020/01/06/migrate-gedmo-to-knplabs/) post to find the answer.

<br>

That's all for me. Use it, bend it, break it, and report issues or pull-request so that we can make migration path together even smoother.

<br>

**I wish you happy new year 2020 full of huge adventures not only in code!**
