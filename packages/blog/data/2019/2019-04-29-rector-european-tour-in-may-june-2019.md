    I asked ≈Åukasz Chru≈õciel if we see each other on one of the conferences I'm coming with Rector and he's like: "I haven't noticed any announcements that you will talk somewhere. Did you set up any long distance trip?"
    <br><br>
    Ops, I forgot to tell you. Let's fix it because I'd love to meet you and hear about your pain points.

**I'd love to thank all people that support Rector, use it in their daily work and continuous integration**. It took a while to get the attention of everyday use. I visited only 1 conference with Rector in 2018, but now **it seems the side is turning**.

I'm not sure who bribed all these folks, **but this year I got accepted to 6 amazing conferences**. I had to turn [Neos Conference](https://www.neoscon.io) down with my deepest apologies, because I couldn't fit the flight to another conference in the same day.

**I'll visit 5 different countries in 30 days**. I never traveled so much and so far in a month. I look forward to all these new countries and even more **I look forward to you PHP folks**!

I already missed a flight this year, so let's hope it will not [happen again](/blog/2018/10/18/how-i-almost-missed-my-talk-in-php-asia-conference/).

## Where Exactly?

There are exact days and places where I'll present my Rector talk:

- Verona, Italy - [PHP Day](https://2019.phpday.it) - **May 10**
- Moscow, Russia - [PHP Russia](https://phprussia.ru/2019) - **May 17**
- Berlin, Germany - [Github Satelite](https://githubsatellite.com) - **May 23** (just hanging out without talk)
- Kiev, Ukraine - [PHP fwdays](https://fwdays.com/en/event/php-fwdays-2019) - **Jun 1**
- Berlin, Germany - [PHP Conference](https://phpconference.com) - **Jun 4**
- Amsterdam, Netherlands - [Dutch PHP Conference](https://www.phpconference.nl) - **Jun 8**

I'll usually visit the city for 2 days around that date.

## Let's Meet and Talk

I'll have limited time, but if you'll [WhatsApp me](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=420776778332&text=Hi%20Tom,%20I'd%20love%20to%20meet%20you%20at%20the%20conference%20:) (or [call/mail](/contact) me), I'd love to grab a beer and talk with you.

**We can talk about** Rector, legacy code, good coffee, communities, traveling, dnb, trains, psychology, mentoring, polyphasic sleep, intuitive education, artificial intelligence, children, 10x programming... whatever comes to our minds :)

<br>

Happy coding!
