title: "Can PHPStan find Dead Public Methods?"
perex: |
    This bold question has been around PHP Internet for many years... [at least since 2008](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11532/how-can-i-find-unused-functions-in-a-php-project). In 2017 I added [dead public method sniff](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/466) to Symplify Coding Standard.
    <br><br>
    It runs on bare PHP tokens without any type or AST, so the capability was limited. Yet it was able to detect a few unused methods. Now, 5 years later, we maybe have a better solution.

[The sniff rule](/blog/2019/03/14/remove-dead-public-methdos-from-your-code/) looked for unused public method with very basic algorithm:

### 1. Collect all Public Methods

```php
public function speedUp()
{
}

public function slowDown()
{
}
```

â†“

- `speedUp`
- `slowDown`

<br>

### 2. Collect all Method Calls

```php
$someObject->speedUp();
```

â†“

- `speedUp`

<br>

### 3. Subtract First List from Second

There we have a list of unused public methods:

- `slowDown`

<br>

That's it!

<br>

This sniff helped to [detect many dead methods](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src/commit/3ef5f555b729dfc7758043674c15ea2354af71f2), but without types, it misses a few essential details:

```php
class Car
{
    public function speedUp()
    {
    }
}
```

```php
class Bus
{
    public function speedUp()
    {
    }
}
```

Like the same-name methods in 2 different classes. Even if only one is used, both are reported as used. Later [I've removed the rule](/blog/2019/03/14/remove-dead-public-methods-from-your-code/), because the token architecture is rather crappy, as you can see.

<br>

A week ago [PHPStan 1.8](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/1.8.0) introduced similar feature, [called collectors](https://phpstan.org/developing-extensions/collectors).
The principle is simple:

* collect one group of data
* collect another group of data
* compare both groups and show the result

<br>

I got excited and wanted to try this feature as soon as I had some free time.

Last week I made the first rule that detects unused public constants:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m roughly playing with new collectors from PHPStan 1.8 ðŸ˜‡<br><br>This is how &quot;unused public constant&quot; is found â†“<a href="https://t.co/SkTCITcLh4">https://t.co/SkTCITcLh4</a> <a href="https://t.co/zt4yyq0Hmh">pic.twitter.com/zt4yyq0Hmh</a></p>&mdash; Tomas Votruba ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ (@VotrubaT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/1542459395203911682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2022</a></blockquote>

<br>

Detecting constant call is relatively easy because there is always one exact class and constant name:

```php
SomeClass::SOME_CONSTANT
```

<br>

We've added rules to a few projects, and the results are fantastic.

How about trying the same approach to public methods?

<br>

## PHPStan Collector for Unused Method

With method calls, this is a bit complex, as caller type could be anything:

```php
$value->speedUp(); // $value is mixed type

function run(?Car $value) {
    $value->speedUp(); // $value is null|Car
}

/** @var Car $value;
$value->speedUp(); // $value is probably Car
```

<br>

I wanted to see how many false positives this rule will catch and try out collectors. Take this as a joyful learning experience.

To keep the rule simple and more reliable, I've narrowed the scope further down:

- skip static methods
- skip protected methods
- skip private methods
- skip `Trait_` methods
- skip `Enum` methods
- skip `Interface` methods
- skip methods overriding parent class
- skip methods required by an interface
- skip methods that have `@api` annotation
- skip methods that has a class with `@api` annotation
- skip methods in PHPUnit test case
- skip methods with an attribute


```php
#[Required]
public function autowire(...)
{
    // ...
}

#[Inject]
public function inject(....)
{
    // ...
}
```

<br>

Are you maintaining an open-source project? Do you have a method that is never called but is designed for external use? Mark it with `@api` to make clear the method is for devs to use. The rule will skip it then.


## Use at Your Own Risk

I've prototyped [the `UnusedPublicClassMethodRule` rule](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/4195). In PR, you'll find both collectors for public methods, their calls, and the rule that compares them both. The test included, of course. Do you want to build a collector of your own? I recommend checking it out and mimicking behavior.

<br>

Are you willing to try this rule on your code base? Even if there will be false positives?

You've been warned. There you go...

```bash
composer require symplify/phpstan-rules --dev
```

<br>

Register rule with both collectors to `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
rules:
    - Symplify\PHPStanRules\DeadCode\UnusedPublicClassMethodRule

services:
    -
        class: Symplify\PHPStanRules\Collector\ClassMethod\PublicClassMethodCollector
        tags:
            - phpstan.collector

    -
        class: Symplify\PHPStanRules\Collector\ClassMethod\MethodCallCollector
        tags:
            - phpstan.collector
```

Run PHPStan and see the results.

Do you have a tip to improve this rule or architecture? It's my 2nd collector rule, and it has flaws in the design, so don't hesitate and share it in the comments so that I can improve it. Thank you, good luck, and have fun!

<br>

Happy coding!
