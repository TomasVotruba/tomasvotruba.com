title: "5 Constant Lists That Give&nbsp;Context to&nbsp;your Integers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Strings"
perex: |
    [Native enums](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/enums) is a new feature since PHP 8.1. This feature brings more focus on *what* enums are *where* we can use it.

    **Not on PHP 8.1 yet?** Don't worry, before that enums were emulated by public constants. Few constant lists are already part of your favorite framework, ORM or utils package for years.
    <br><br>
    Today we look on 5 constant lists, that you can use today to replace that `int` or `string` and give it a context.

## Why even Bother with Enums?

```php
if ($duration < 14400) {
   return 'today';
}

return 'later;
```

<br>

We might ask, why even bother using some constants? Everybody knows 14400 is number of minutes in a day, or is it seconds... or is it 1440?

```diff
-if ($duration < 14400) {
+if ($duration < self::DAY_IN_MINUTES) {
    return 'today';
 }

 return 'later;
```

Using constant removes these questions. Somebody already did the calculation before me and was much better in the result. We avoid crash of [thinking fast and thinking slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) at the same time - great book about how we think about others peoples' thinking.

<br>

There is [more pratcical benefits in using constants over scalars](/blog/2020/07/16/10-cool-features-you-get-after-switching-from-yaml-to-php-configs#10-Constants-over-Strings):

* we **give the context** to any reader, who will come 5 years later
* we reduce maintenance of all usages **to single place**
* and we don't have to ever think about it anymore

<br>

I've shared one such constant on a Twitter, and it so much traction and responses than I expected:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know <a href="https://twitter.com/symfony?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@symfony</a> offers constant codes for HTTP?<br><br>Since PHP 8.1 even more useful as enum! <a href="https://t.co/n1jpBYiu8i">pic.twitter.com/n1jpBYiu8i</a></p>&mdash; Tomas Votruba üá∫üá¶ (@VotrubaT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/1502360490328080384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

I've picked **the best and least known constant lists** in this post.

<br>

Ready for some hot constant code? Let's go:

## 1. HTTP Response Codes

After calling outside API service, we have to verify the result or the reason why it failed. Codes like 404 and 200 are mainstream, but what about the less known ones?

Can you tell me in 2 seconds, what is the condition checking here?

```php
$response = $this->callExternalApi(...);
if ($response->getCode() === 403) {
    // what happened?
}
```

We know something is wrong... maybe something was not found? Maybe the url is outdated?

*Maybe* is not good enough and maybe, we can simply read it:

```diff
+use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

 $response = $this->callExternalApi(...);
-if ($response->getCode() === 403) {
+if ($response->getCode() === Response::HTTP_FORBIDDEN) {
     // what happened?
 }
```

This also makes clear, what is HTTP response value, what is [Calgary telephone code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_403#:~:text=Area%20code%20403%20is%20a,assigned%20by%20AT%26T%20in%201947) and what is made up integer id we use for test.


### Where is the List?

- [`Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2f27b39add8c8cdf7c70f2acfe8c9905eb56dfcc/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.php#L24-L86)
- [`Nette\Http\IResponse`](https://github.com/nette/http/blob/17314395a830257e5db7167d5cccd1e6d1183ac9/src/Http/IResponse.php#L18-L79)


## 2. Request Methods

Where is a response, there must be a request first:

```php
$response = $this->callExternalApi(..., 'get');
```

We've all debugged an external API. If we're lucky, it has a documentation. **If we're not lucky, the documentation is outdated** and the endpoint silently fails (I look at you Twitter, Meetup.com...).

Few hours later we try the constant out of despair:

```diff
+use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

-$response = $this->callExternalApi(..., 'get');
+$response = $this->callExternalApi(..., Request::METHOD_GET);
```

And it works!

<br>

Why? Some API packages can mitigate the lowercased `"get"` to correct `"GET"`, but some can not. **We can mitigate bugs like these** by using a standardized constant that uses the correct version.

<br>

### Where is the List?

* [`Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2f27b39add8c8cdf7c70f2acfe8c9905eb56dfcc/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L54-L63)
* [`Nette\Http\IRequest`](https://github.com/nette/http/blob/17314395a830257e5db7167d5cccd1e6d1183ac9/src/Http/IRequest.php#L21-L28)

<br>

P.S. Be creative... where else do we use `"GET"` or `"POST"` methods?

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

final class PostController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route(path: '/blog/{slug}', methods: [Request::METHOD_GET])]
    public function __invoke(string $slug): Response
    {
    }
}
```


## 3. An hour, a Month or a Year?

During my 19-years PHP developer career, I've used the calculator countless times just to produce correct *time numbers* like ~~`8640`~~... ehm, `86400`.

<br>

The moment I saw following constant list first time, it blew both my mind and calculator away:

```diff
+use Nette\Utils\DateTime;

-if ($durationInSeconds < 86400) {
+if ($durationInSeconds < DateTime::DAY) {
     return 'less than a day';
 }

 return 'keep waiting';
```

The `DAY_IN_SECONDS` name would be better, but at least the constant has comment to clarify this.

<br>

These constants come very handy with header expiration or [*time to leave* (TTLs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) in cache:

```php
use Nette\Utils\DateTime;

$httpResponse->setHeader('Access-Control-Max-Age', 12 * DateTime::HOUR);
```

### Where is the List?

* [`Nette\Utils\DateTime`](https://github.com/nette/utils/blob/4f7d3da873c4e3762cf7ebb9d3073efcd1bd56fc/src/Utils/DateTime.php#L22-L38)



## 4. Accurate Event Subscribers

In Symfony event system, there is probably dozens of event we can hook into. We already [use subscribers over listeners](/blog/2019/05/16/don-t-ever-use-listeners/) and the `getSubscribedEvents()` method:

```php
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

final class SomeEventSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents(): array
    {
        return [
            'kernel.controller' => ['onKernelController'],
        ];
    }
}
```

<br>

Instead of strings for event names, we can use Symfony constant list:

```diff
+use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\KernelEvents;

 return [
-    'kernel.controller' => ['onKernelController'],
+    KernelEvents::CONTROLLER => ['onKernelController'],
 ];
```

<br>

Thanks to this constant, we **open previously hidden knowledge** = where is the event invoked and what subscribers use the event:

### Where are the Lists?

* [`Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\KernelEvents`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.1/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/KernelEvents.php#L28-L111)
* [`Symfony\Component\Console\ConsoleEvents`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2f27b39add8c8cdf7c70f2acfe8c9905eb56dfcc/src/Symfony/Component/Console/ConsoleEvents.php#L24-L59)
* [`Symfony\Component\Security\Http\SecurityEvents`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2f27b39add8c8cdf7c70f2acfe8c9905eb56dfcc/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/SecurityEvents.php#L19-L36)


## 5. Doctrine Column Types

Back in the PHP 7.4-day we use to write Doctrine annotations in a weird string-like format, called comments, right above the property:

```php

```


### Where is the Lists?

* [`Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Types`](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/83f779beaea1893c0bece093ab2104c6d15a7f26/src/Types/Types.php#L12-L36)

## Who do we Write Code For?

Now we know *what* constant enum-like lists can we use, but I'd like to return back to *why* we use them. We all know that `200` is success code, and `301` is permanent redirect... but do we know how much bits is in 1024 bytes?

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
"We don't write the code for us at the present.<br>
We write for future fellow developers we'll never meet."
</blockquote>

If put more attention to write standardized code now, future developers will thank us for making their life easier. Maybe we will also thanks ourselves ;).

## Honorable Mentions

* [`Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command::SUCCESS|FAILURE`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2f27b39add8c8cdf7c70f2acfe8c9905eb56dfcc/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Command/Command.php#L36-L39) for command line exit codes in `Command::execute()` and CLI apps
* [`Psr\Log\LogLevel::*`](https://github.com/php-fig/log/blob/fe5ea303b0887d5caefd3d431c3e61ad47037001/src/LogLevel.php#L10-L17) for logging - thanks to [Oliver Nybroe](https://twitter.com/OliverNybroe/status/1503308677306011650)

Have I missed constant list that you use daily and makes your life easier? Share in comments or on Twitter, so we can put it here too.
