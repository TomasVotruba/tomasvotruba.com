title: "5 Steps to Get Ready for Latte 3"
perex: |
    After 3 months of intensive testing, David released [Latte 3.0](https://github.com/nette/latte/releases/tag/v3.0.0) two days ago, with massive evolution under the hood. We've been using it [in Amateri](https://www.startupjobs.cz/nabidka/24580/hleda-se-senior-php-programator-se-zapalem-pro-vec) past weeks, and today I will share our experience with you about how **to get prepared for it**.

Today, our goal is not to get your project to Latte 3. Developers of Latte Extensions will need a few weeks to catch up with the upgrade and test it, as macros have entirely new syntax.

Despite that, there are a few steps that we can **do before the upgrade itself to prepare** for boarding the beautiful ship called Latte 3.

## 1. Replace `{ifCurrent ...}` with `{if isLinkCurrent(...)}`

The macro `ifCurrent` calls function `isLinkCurrent` on the background. It will trigger an error in Latte 3.

Now, use the function directly instead:

```diff
 <a href="/friends" class="
-    {ifCurrent friends}active{/ifCurrent}
+    {if isLinkCurrent('friends')}active{/if}
 ">Friends</a>
```

And also:

```diff
-{ifCurrent 'meeting:lunch'}eat{/ifCurrent}
+{if isLinkCurrent('meeting:lunch')}win{/if}
```

<br>

**üí° Tip: Do you use PHPStorm?** This is [the regex](https://github.com/TomasVotruba/barista/blob/fce40f5805cfbd529e4ae1bcdd22890db9a66164/src/Upgrade/IfCurrentLatteSyntaxUpgrader.php#L16) that handles change for you.

<br>

There is a particular case for the `n:ifCurrent` macro that is better to handle manually:

```diff
-<a href="/profile/change-password" n:ifCurrent="profile">Change Password</a>
+{if isLinkCurrent('profile')}
+    <a href="/profile/change-password">Change Password</a>
+{/if}
```

## 2. Get the Latest Latte 2.* version

This version is the latest you can get from 2.11.*. It does not break anything, and it helps you with the upgrade:

```bash
composer require latte/latte:^2.11.3
```

Do you have it in your project? Great, now we can use it in the next step ‚Üì

## 3. Try Latte Linter Today

Syntax changes are [described in this forum post](https://forum.nette.org/cs/35141-latte-3-nejvetsi-vyvojovy-skok-v-dejinach-nette#p219574), but how many of those **are actually in our project**? Maybe all of them? In our case it was just 4.

But how can we find them quickly? With the new Latte linter command. Just run it in CLI:

```bash
vendor/bin/latte-lint templates
```

<br>

During our testing, we assumed linter is an intelligent static analyzer (like PHPStan) that will not let us make mistakes. That's not the case.

The *linter* only **checks the syntax of the Latte language is valid**. It does not have the context or logic of your Latte files. Something like `php -l`.

<br>

Latte linter has a few spots to improve:

* It create own isolated `Latte\Engine`. That means it misses your custom macros and filters. You [can hack in your Latte Engine](https://github.com/nette/latte/blob/8742292dc2723fd42dd9f0b928a0c8e0764df0b2/src/Tools/Linter.php#L21), but it seems like a heavy workaround.
* The CI will keep failing because of these errors, so you have to allow the job to fail or skip it completely
* It only accepts directories as arguments, so you can't check a single Latte file:

```bash
vendor/bin/latte-lint templates/single-file.latte
```

David is committing improvement coming the last 2 days, so upcoming patch versions might change it.

<br>

Latte **syntax is now CASE sensitive** and the Linter will tell you where it matters:

```diff
-{foreach $items AS $item}
+{foreach $items as $item}
```

Let me know in the comments what deprecations you've found in your code.

## 4. Prepare for the Translations

Since Latte 3, there are few changes in translate macros as we know them:

```html
{_$bookTitle}
```

<br>

The single `_` still works, but the dual `_` macro **will be replaced by `translate`**:

```diff
-{_}Nice tree! How do you grow it?{/_}
+{translate}Nice tree! How do you grow it?{/translate}
```

<br>

The `_`, `-` or `:` could be part the language syntax. I think this is an improvement, as "translate" is self-explanatory.

<br>

**Warning**: the `translate` macro is not yet available in Latte 2.x. I think it's worth mentioning, as in our case, it means a change of hundreds of cases, and we have to prepare a plan to get ready for it.

## 5. Ping Your Latte 3.* Dependencies

Let's say our project is ready, we've updated all macros, Latte syntax, and Latte linter works. We want to board Latte 3...

But what about **the external Latte extensions we use**? We can find out easily by triggering the requirements:

```bash
composer require latte/latte:^3.0
```

Does the install pass? Congratulations, there is no blocker in your vendor and you're ready to sail!

<br>

Has the composer reported some conflicts?

* https://github.com/milo/embedded-svg
* https://github.com/contributte/mailing (dev-master allows)
* https://github.com/nextras/mail-panel

Help out these packages to:

* allow `latte/latte` 3.0
* fix possible BC breaks

The sooner these packages are ready and tagged, the sooner whole Latte 3 community can sail together.

<br>

How to upgrade a Latte extension to Latte 3? Stay tuned for the next post.
If you want to know earlier, we [are looking for a new lazy and curious PHP colleague](https://www.startupjobs.cz/en/job/24580/hleda-se-senior-php-programator-se-zapalem-pro-vec).

Happy coding!
