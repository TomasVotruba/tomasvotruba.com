title: "How to Develop Sole Package in PHP 8.1 and Downgrade to PHP 7.2"
perex: |
The PHP downgrades are a thing. Most beneficial for package developers who want to move forward to the latest PHP features but also want to **keep easy access to the broad PHP community and legacy projects**.
<br><br>
The downgrade of a tool is a no-brainer - [we downgrade the whole tool](https://getrector.org/blog/how-to-bump-minimal-version-without-leaving-anyone-behind) including vendor, and we know it will run on PHP 7.2.
<br>
<br>
But how to achieve the same with the package with separated dependencies?

    nobody will use it."

## 1. Developer in one Repository, Release in Another

Before we get into the downgrade of the package itself, we have to have the repository prepared for the downgraded release. We have 1 repository for developing code and another for its releases.

<br>

Do you know such an example from packages in your project?

- `symfony/symfony` is a development repository that is split into many `symfony/*` packages that we download via composer
- `rector/rector-src` is a development repository that we downgrade and prefix to `rector/rector`
- `phpstan/phpstan-src` is a development repository that we downgrade, wrap to phar and prefix to `phpstan/phpstan`

With 2 different repositories, we can put a downgrade process in the middle with a single line in GitHub Action.

<br>

Do we have two repositories? Now comes the fun part.

<br>

## 2. What Required Dependencies do We Control?

With the classical downgrade, we can **work with the newest dependencies possible because we also publish and downgrade the whole vendor**. With a package, it's slightly different.

The package is still part of the dependency tree as we know it. We can only downgrade the `/src` of our package, and we still depend on packages in the `"require"` section of `composer.json`.

There are 2 challenges we have to deal with. What packages are part of our PHP 8.1 ecosystem? Let's look at an example of `symplify/phpstan-rules` that I wanted to release as a downgraded package. It has a fantastic set of PHPStan rules that come in handy on legacy projects.

<br>

What does the `composer.json` look like?

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=8.1",
        "nikic/php-parser": "^4.14.0",
        "nette/utils": "^3.2",
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^1.8.1",
        "symplify/astral": "^11.0.9",
        "symplify/composer-json-manipulator": "^11.0.9",
        "symplify/package-builder": "^11.0.9",
        "symplify/smart-file-system": "^11.0.9"
    }
}
```

We see we have 3 external packages we cannot influence. Let's forget those for now.

### Getting Rid of Dependencies

Then we see 4 Symplify packages that we own. Those 4 Symplify packages require PHP 8.1 and will not allow installing our package on PHP 7.2. **What can we do about it?**

* we can downgrade those 4 packages too
* we can eliminate the dependency and inline the needed code

<br>

The 1st option seems obvious, yet we would also have to downgrade all the dependencies of those packages and all dependencies of those dependencies... suddenly we don't work with a single package, but with a matrix of 4 times *n* packages.

Maybe the easier option is to review the need for our own packages. **If we require a package for 10 or so classes, we could inline them** and solve the problem.

<br>

I explore the classes and see the need for 3 of these dependencies as a matter of 2 classes. Let's copy them so we can downgrade them. The last package, `symplify/astral`, was a heavy dependency, but in the end, I moved 5 classes to the `src` and made it work.

<br>

**Now we have a single `/src` directory with code we own**. The rest of the dependencies are external, and let's look at those.



## 3. What external Dependencies Allow the Target version?

This variable is out of our control, but a standard is to target PHP 7.2 nowadays as the minimum version. If not, you can always allow multiple package versions.

How about our specific packages?

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.2|^8.0",
        "nikic/php-parser": "^4.14.0",
        "nette/utils": "^3.2",
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^1.8.1"
    }
}
```

* the `nikic/php-parser` required PHP 7.0 - we're good âœ…
* the `nette/utils` requires PHP 7.2 âœ…
* the `phpstan/phpstan` requires PHP 7.2 âœ…

<br>

It looks great - all our dependencies require PHP 7.2 at least, so this package is now installable on PHP 7.2.

<br>

## 4. Add the Downgrade Step

The last step we have to do is add the actual downgrade to the release step. We have our PHP 8.1 `composer.json` for development and the one above for PHP 7.2+. This process is the same for all the downgrades. Do you want to learn more about it? [I wrote about it here](https://getrector.org/blog/how-to-bump-minimal-version-without-leaving-anyone-behind).

<br>

And the result?
We've already installed the package on the PHP 7.4 project, used it in CI, and discovered bugs with 110 new PHPStan rules. Life is great :)
