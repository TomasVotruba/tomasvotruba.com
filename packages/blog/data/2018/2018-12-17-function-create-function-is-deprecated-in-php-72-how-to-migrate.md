title: "Function create_function() is Deprecated in PHP 7.2 - How to Migrate?"
perex: |
    If there would be "Miss Deprecation of PHP 7.2", `create_function()` would definitely win. They can be **very complex, tricky and very hard convert to PHP code**. Moreover without tests.


    Do you have over 5 `create_function()` pieces in your code? Let's see how to migrate them.

    Updated Rector YAML to PHP configuration, as current standard.

Why is this deprecated? Well, the string arguments of few functions behaves like `eval()` - that's [evil](https://stackoverflow.com/a/951868/1348344).

```php
<?php

create_function("$a", "return $a");
assert("$value == 5");
```

And what about quotes?

```php
<?php

create_function("$a", "return $a");
create_function('$a', 'return $a');
```

You don't want to think which if `"` or <code>`</code> breaks the code - you want make code.

I think it's a good move, **so how do we refactor them?** Let's start with simple code:

```php
<?php

$callback = create_function('$matches', "return strtolower(\$matches[1]);");
```

**How would you refactor this to anonymous function?**

*(Pause for deep thinking...)*

```php
<?php

$callback = function ($matches) {
    return strtolower($matches[1]);
};
```

As you can see:

- 1st argument = function arguments
- 2nd argument = function body

Also, notice the `\$matches` → `$matches`. That's because quote escaping.

<br>

What about this one?

```php
<?php

create_function('$a,$b', "return \"min(b^2+a, a^2,b) = \".min(\$a*\$a+\$b,\$b*\$b+\$a);");
```

**How would you refactor this to anonymous function?**

*(Pause for deep thinking...)*

```php
<?php

function ($a, $b) {
    return "min(b^2+a, a^2,b) = " . min($a * $a + $b, $b * $b + $a);
};
```

The `"min(b^2+a, a^2,b) = "` is still a string, because it was escaped string in a string.

Too easy for you? Damn, you're smart.

<br>

Can you handle this?

```php
<?php

create_function('$b,$a', 'if (strncmp($a, $b, 3) == 0) return "** \"$a\" '.
            'and \"$b\"** Look the same to me! (looking at the first 3 chars)";');
```

**How would you refactor this to anonymous function?**

*(Pause for deep thinking...)*

```php
<?php

function ($b, $a) {
    if (strncmp($a, $b, 3) == 0) {
        return "** \"{$a}\" and \"{$b}\"** Look the same to me! (looking at the first 3 chars)";
    }
};
```

<br>

Ok, but you won't make this code snippet I found in Drupal/Wordpress:

```php
<?php

$this->map_xmlns_func = create_function('$p,$n', 'if(strlen($n[0])>0) $xd
    .= ":{$n[0]}"; return "{$xd}=\"{$n[1]}\"";');
```

**How would you refactor this to anonymous function?**

*(Pause for deep thinking...)*

```php
<?php

$this->map_xmlns_func = function ($p, $n) use ($xd) {
    if (strlen($n[0]) > 0) {
        $xd .= ":{$n[0]}";
    }
    return "{$xd}=\"{$n[1]}\"";
};
```

Who did forget `use ($xd)`? An anonymous function can't access variables that are not passed as arguments, so without this would crash.

<br>

And we could continue and continue with more *edgy* cases... but I bet **you're looking for a solution for your specific function**.
Well, you could ask on StackOverflow ([181 results and counting](https://www.google.com/search?q="deprecated"+"create_function"+"php"+"7.2"+site%3Astackoverflow.com+-preg_replace&oq="deprecated"+"create_function"+"php"+"7.2"+site%3Astackoverflow.com+-preg_replace)), but posting each of your 10 cases might get you banned. I have good news for you.

Today in 2019 (almost there), you can instantly upgrade your code and it **will take you less time to install & run, then read this whole post so far**.

Just setup [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) and run it:

```bash
composer require rector/rector --dev
```

```php
use Rector\Php72\Rector\FuncCall\CreateFunctionToAnonymousFunctionRector;
use Rector\Config\RectorConfig;

return function (RectorConfig $rectorConfig): void {
    $rectorConfig->rule(CreateFunctionToAnonymousFunctionRector::class);
};
```

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process src
```

<br>

Happy instant upgrading!
