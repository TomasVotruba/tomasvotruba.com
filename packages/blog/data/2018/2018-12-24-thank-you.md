title: "Thank You"
perex: |
    This was an amazing year for me. I made so many things happen - I won't write about them since you can see them on [the homepage]() and [my Github](https://github.com/tomasvotruba).
    <br><br>
    I want to write about you, my dear reader and contributor. **I would not make it this far without you in 2018.**

Thank you for discussion under the post - it often leads me to think about the topic in-depth and from different perspectives. Thank you for keeping comments constructive and creative. Thank you for sharing gists to your approach to coding.

- Thank you for emoticons under the post, that way I know many of you like gifs and diffs :).

- Thank you for fixing my typos and contributing to this blog. I've added "Thank you" page to make your [contributions visible](/thank-you).

- Thank you for your comments and votes on [Reddit /r/php](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP). It gives me an idea, how skilled developers from countries all over the world see PHP.

- Thanks for the amazing and warm meetups in Berlin, Vienna, and Singapore. I really appreciate the place to sleepover (you know who you are) and passionate discussions.

**Thanks for your feedback that keeps me going**. Thanks to you I could set myself for a goal to write 2 posts a week. I failed a lot in the start. I tried and I failed. But your feedback kept me on track. I saw you're into controversial topics no-one talks about and in short and useful examples of how to code and how not to code. And why! Without you, I would not write 96 posts this year. I've very grateful PHP community is such [a big family all over the World](https://friendsofphp.org) and I'm happy you've made me feel welcomed.

## You're Amazing

I'm really amazed by this because the job of a programmer is to find bugs and fix them. We find mistakes, we're biased that way and it reflects in our communication. Well, you - the community around me - prove this wrong almost every day. Programmers are such nice people, **who can appreciate each other and respect each other's work, even if they don't agree with him or her**.

That's very important in relationships to allow growth and staying connected.

I don't share this with you to brag about myself. I write this to show, **how easy is to be nice**. All of these messages made me feel warm.

When was the last time you said something like that to **your colleague**? And when was the last time you said "there's a bug" or "it's wrong". Maybe similar words that made me happy, would make your colleague happy. Maybe it would reinforce the same behavior to people around him or her. Try it :)

<br><br>

Thank you again, **you allow me to follow my passion** - that's the best gift I could wish for!

<br>

Merry Christmas You All!
