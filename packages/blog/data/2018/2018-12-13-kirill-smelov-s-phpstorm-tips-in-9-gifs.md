title: "Kirill Smelov's PHPStorm Tips in 9 Gifs"
perex: |
    Last week we hosted [Kirill Smelov](https://twitter.com/wbasrs) in [Friends of PHP meetup](https://www.meetup.com/friends-of-php-prague/events/256838837) in Prague. Usually, I know most of tricks people show in PHPStorm talks or they pick too complicated cases - like SSH to Docker via PHPStorm GUI.
    <br><br>
    Kirill's talk was completely different, **I could not stop taking notes** about simple yet less known features of PHPStorm.
    <br><br>
    Instead of watching the 45-min talk, **enjoy 9 cherry picked tips in 4,5-min gifs**. I've dropped a few of my own daily habits. Enjoy!

## 1. Ctor - when you add a property via constructor

## 2. Post-Fix

Do you type the same code around a variable zillion times?

<br><br><br>

## 3. Forget `$this->`

<br><br><br>

## 4. Jump to Next use of Method

## 9. Create a shortcut

<br><br><br>

## How to Work With Shortcuts?

Get inspired by watching others, but in the end - **always respect your brain**. Every one of you has **different preferences**.

Let say you create a shortcut "new file":

 - you might like starting letter of action: `nf`
 - or 2 letters of each word: `nefi`
 - or just one letter, because you use 1 action per letter: `n`

## Punish vs. Typo-Proof

Also, as I love to type fast like crazy, I often make a typo or don't remember the exact 2 letters. Why punish yourself for a typo or not remembering the right combination?

**Add a fallback:**

- *rf* ‚Üí `return false;`
- *refa* ‚Üí `return false;`
- *ref* ‚Üí `return false;`
- *reaf* ‚Üí `return false;`

To give you an idea of my daily work, here is my current list of live templates:

## Start with Single Step

I took notes about 15 items during Kirill's talk. They all were very interesting and I wanted to integrate at least 5 of them the very next day. I was excited about my skills going the speed of light. I put too much on myself, then I was afraid I will fail to integrate them all. So I ended-up using just one.

What could I do different? **Pick just one tip**. Master it and then move to another.

    What is the 1 tip you'll use tomorrow?

Integrate it and if you want more, you can always come back to this post.
