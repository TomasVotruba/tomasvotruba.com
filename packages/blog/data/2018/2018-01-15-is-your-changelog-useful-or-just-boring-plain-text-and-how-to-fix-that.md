title: "Is Your CHANGELOG Useful or Just Boring Plain Text? And How to Fix That"
perex: |
    Do you [keep a CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com)? You should! I [do](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), because it's the main story about the open-source package.
    <br><br>
    And if you do, is it boring plain text or **useful rich markdown**?

This post is written in Markdown. Would you read it if it looked like this?

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        I wrote about monorepo before and - as ShopSyS and Google agrees - it's the best choice for longterm projects, like children or planet projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover now, when Vitek showed me awesome tool called Tomono, that can merge git history from multiple repositories...
    </div>
</div>

Or this one:

    <div class="card-body">

## What is Sad about..

### ...Missing References?

Imagine you'll read my post first *plain text* version. While reading it, you might think:

- What is this monorepo? Isn't that *monolith* - an antipattern?
- I didn't know Google is using monorepo?
- Is that true name or made-up one?

You could read answer to all those questions if I'd only provide links - but **you can't, because there are no links**. You'd have to go to comments, ask them, wait for answers... So you'll probably end up closing my blog and never come again.

### ...Plain Text `CHANGELOG.md`?

It takes maintainer **a lot of effort** to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), keep it updated, with every version and every new pull-request, refer issues, pull-request, @author references...

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-5">
    "Too many cooks spoil the broth."
</blockquote>

No surprise that most `CHANGELOG.md` files look like this:


```markdown
## v3.2.0 - 2018-01-18

### Changed

- #560 Added `PhpdocVarWithoutNameFixer` to `docblock.neon` level, thanks to @carusogabriel
- #578 Use `@doesNotPerformAssertions` in tests, thanks to @carusogabriel
```

Does your `CHANGELOG.md` look like this too? Is it just dump of [pull-requests](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) combined with [releases](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/releases)?

## Why do we Look to Changelog?

To find an answer:

- What has changed in new version?
- If it was `@deprecated`, what is the replacement?
- **Most often when it broke our code** and we're angry: what are the reasons for this change?
- How did it work before?
- Was there some issue?
- Who is that active person behind all pull-requests for this release?

I've asked all these questions when I was investigating bug in packages I used.

Often, release descriptions are not so detailed. In that case it is **really helpful to have comparison to previous version**, e.g. [3.1 to 3.2](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0).

But all of this requires time. A time that maintainer usually puts to new features or resolving bugs.

When I added [`CHANGELOG.md` to Symplify](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and moved all notes from [Github Releases](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/releases) there, I was in the same situation. Do I create new features or rather play and cuddle with my `CHANGELOG.md`?


## Can't let go? Automate!

I wanted both. Why? Because I was used to Github Released that work like I needed:

```markdown
## v3.2.0 - 2018-01-18

### Changed

- [#560](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/560) Added `PhpdocVarWithoutNameFixer` to `docblock.yml` level,
   thanks to [@carusogabriel](https://github.com/carusogabriel)
- [#578](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/578) Use `@doesNotPerformAssertions` in tests,
   thanks to [@carusogabriel](https://github.com/carusogabriel)
```

I've closed myself to coffee house for 3 hours and I've came up with solution!

**A [Changelog Linker](https://github.com/Symplify/ChangelogLinker) was born**.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/changelog/links.png" class="img-thumbnail">

## 3 Steps To Add Links To Your `CHANGELOG.md`

### 1. Install

```bash
composer require symplify/changelog-linker --dev
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
vendor/bin/changelog-linker run
```

It will complete links to:

- **PRs and issues**
    ```markdown
    [#1](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/1) - fix everything
    ```

- **Version Diffs**
    ```markdown
    # [v2.0.0](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0)
    ```

- **Users**
    ```markdown
    Thanks to [@SpacePossum](https://github.com/SpacePossum)
    ```

### 3. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "CHANGELOG: add links to PRs, issues, version diffs and user names"
git push origin master
```

That's it!

I'm sorry I didn't follow this rule from [PHP Package Checklist](http://phppackagechecklist.com/#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) and used Github Releases instead. But **now I have no more excuses**.

I hope you to...
