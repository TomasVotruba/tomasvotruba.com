    Nowadays we tend to live busy life with all those social networks, notifications and pings. So busy, we don't have emotional space to just evaluate "How do I like that?".

Before I started this article, I read
[I Quit Twitter And My Life Got Better. Here's Why I'm Going Back](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2015/11/11/i-quit-twitter-and-my-life-got-better-heres-why-im-going-back). In the article Lauren describes **what was it like to have 1 week without Twitter and why she got back**. If you use Twitter, I recommend you reading it. There are some great insights on autopilot behavior.

Now here is my story...

I felt bad using Twitter last few months. **I wasn't sure** if I really want to quit Twitter.

### I Tried Small Experiments Hoping To Get Better

- I un-followed people down to zero.
- I limited my time there to 10 minutes in the evening.
- I tried different approach for Tweets and retweets:
    - pools to engage with followers
    - retweet the most popular Tweets from the past
    - mention multiple people
    - use 5+ hashtags
    - add 1 to 5 images
- I talked with friends how do they enjoy Twitter.
- I requested feedback from marketing expert to my Tweets.
- I tried using services to automate like [Buffer](https://buffer.com) (thank you [Tomáš Fejfar](https://www.tomasfejfar.cz) for the tip) or [Twitter API PHP packages](https://github.com/search?l=PHP&q=twitter&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

I really tried, but none of these made me feel significantly better. So last experiment: I quit.

*Interesting. This is very similar to my approach to crisis in relationships.*

**What were those deal breakers that tear us apart?**


## 1. I was Addicted - Give me my Dopamine Shot!

Every like made me happy. **Every retweet made happier three-times**. I only wanted to invest just a little attention, so I refocused on numbers instead of content.
**It's like trying to build a deep connection with somebody having only a 20 minutes a day**. This frustrated me a lot, because I prefer working on content over collecting numbers.

I talked about my addiction with [Petr Vácha](http://petrvacha.com) and my intentions to quit, and he **suggested me to use it only once a day**.
I tried it for few days and it was great. I got higher dopamine shots in the end of the day.

The only issue for me was **I had to focus to not to think on Twitter throughout the whole day**. It was like starving the whole day to eat once in the evening.
It worked technically, **but it didn't feel right**. I could spend 5 minutes on 10 social networks and spend less than hour, but I want to enjoy this by heart, not by my inner computer.

I know I can't do something for only 50 %. I either do it close to 100 % or go another way.


## 2. I Tried so Hard to Look Good

- I planned Tweets for one per day, so I won't spam.
- I retweeted Tweets I found interesting.
- I've added images, hashtags.
- I have read many how-to-tweet articles.
- I tweeted only valuable and positive stuffs. Not in relation to reality, really.

Few month later I realized **I'm turning into news machine**. So I asked my followers, [how do you use Twitter](https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/816753682482085896)?

I found there are many news channel that already cover this field.

Second, **I found I have reactive-response syndrome: for every message I have to have an answer**. It's close to [fear of missing out](https://zenhabits.net/miss).

That included conversations under tweets, checking Twitter often for new answers, and trials to explain complex problems and miss-understandings under 140 characters.


## 3. It's Boring

Twitter innovated its service maybe twice since I used it, not much news. Also social adaptions is slow - not many new people are joining Twitter.

I was trying to find fun in service that didn't gave it to me. **It's like seeking a passion in relationship with woman I'm not attracted to.**

What I like about Facebook, Github or PHPStorm is that **they evolve and innovate**. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't, but **I know they are trying to be better**.

If Twitter was a person, it would be fearful virgin in his 30ties sticking to first job with no girlfriend.


## 4. I already Love Somebody Else

140 limit for Tweet is fine, but I want to get deeper. I also don't like random Tweet stream: one day 50 tweets, other day 5. What the hell, man? That's so schizophrenic.

**I love system, regularity and predictability**. This is the best way to educate constantly in certain speed.

That's why I switched from Tweetdeck-hashtag-group-following based to regular newsletter one in last year.

I started to follow:

- [PHP Annotated Monthly](https://info.jetbrains.com/PHP-Annotated-Subscription.html) from JetBrains (PHPStorm guys)
- [PHP Weekly](http://www.phpweekly.com)
- [Měsíčník pro Péhápkaře](https://pehapkari.cz/#newsletter)
- [Jan Růžička - Týden v Médiích](https://www.respekt.cz/echo/neco-konci-neco-zacina) (in the bottom)
- [Pink Cast](http://www.danpink.com/pinkcast)

And it's much better.


## I Love Experiments

Leo Babauta happily dropped Twitter in 2013. In [Simplify the internet](https://zenhabits.net/unline) he wrotes:

> If you’re going to do Facebook, don’t do other ones too. You can quit Twitter and Instagram. Really you can!

Reading this first time in December, I felt it's the right thing to do, yet brain was opposing with "that is insane!".

My great inspiration from polyphasic sleep days Steve Pavlina [got social media dumped hard](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2014/07/social-media-you-got-dumped).

> I basically asked myself which scenario seemed best over the next 10 years — going social media-free vs. continuing to use it.

Followed by [a year later reflection](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2015/07/one-year-without-social-media).

**I love social experiments.** After [polyphasic sleep](https://psychologie.cz/serialy/polyfazicky-spanek), switching main job focus after 8 years, having a baby while being infertile, dropping from university, moving to Prague after settling down in Brno, [dropping LinkedIn](/blog/2017/01/05/why-I-deleted-my-linkedin-account/) and moving completely alone for the first time, **I really look forward to this one**.


### Where Do You Find Me?

See [contact page](/contact).


### What about Your Socials Experiments?

I've already asked, why and what social networks do you use. Now, I would like to know, **have you made any social network experiment?**
How did it go? Did you like that?

I look forward to your answers!
