title: "Go PHP 7.1!"
perex: |
    PHP frameworks start to require PHP 7.1, leading with Nette 3 and Symfony 4.
    <br><br>
    Why skip PHP 7.0 and go directly to PHP 7.1? When is the best time to join?
    What projects are already "on the move"?

## Why Go Right to PHP 7.1

- When you migrate your project from 5.x to PHP 7.x, **there is no reason not to jump right to 7.1**. You get more features (like `void` and nullable types), longer security support and with that, **you will have a longer break from another upgrade**. Are you lazy enough to have a year longer break? I am.

- **Frameworks are migrating**. And let's be honest - huge frameworks are flag ships of evolution. Join them and you won't be left behind.

- It would be easier to develop open-source, if we were able to agree on one recent PHP version to support.

And I think you are already able to come with few more reasons of your own.


## How to Move Hosts?

As in every new version of PHP, **most of us still ~~depends on~~ waits for hosts to catch up**. The situation was the same with PHP 5. New software version was already there, but hosts took their time. If there would be some way to move this.

**And then, a [GoPHP5](https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/go-php-5-go) movement was born, to rapidly speed this up.**

Quoting Larry:

"The solution a few people suggested was team work. If all PHP projects stopped supporting PHP 4 and made the jump to PHP 5 at the same time, none of them is penalized in the market for being "first" and web hosts will have a clear business case to upgrade their systems to PHP 5. We can then all start offering faster, cleaner, more powerful, more secure web software.

**But how does one get all PHP projects together to agree on something like that? Actually, it's fairly simple. You ask them.**"

Well said.


### Go PHP 7.1 as One

I was reading a post about [Symfony 2 min version bump 5.3](https://symfony.com/blog/why-will-symfony-2-0-finally-use-php-5-3).
It was a huge step in PHP development. Even if PHP 5.3 seem like an prehistoric version, many projects still uses that.

We are in same situation with PHP 7.1 now. **If PHP community can cooperate as one, we are able to create brighter future for ourselves**.


## When and Who? goPHP71.org

To better coordinate min version bump, I've created gophp71.org in last 2 evenings.

There you can see **who and when is bumping min version**.

## How Can You Help?

- Do you want to express your support for PHP 7.1?
- Do you want to help others to coordinate their package development?

**If you answered YES at least once, add your framework or package**.

Website is [hosted on Github Pages](https://github.com/tomasvotruba/goPHP71.org), so you just [edit `index.html`](https://github.com/TomasVotruba/gophp71.org/edit/master/index.html) and send PR.

### Spread the Word

If you believe in this, share this page so we let hosts know, what we really need. **It's our need to express and responsibility to take.**
We can do it! Thank you.
