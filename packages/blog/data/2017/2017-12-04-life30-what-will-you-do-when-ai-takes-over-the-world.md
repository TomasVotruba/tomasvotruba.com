title: "Life 3.0: What Will You Do When AI Takes Over the World"
perex: |
    Do you remember cell phones? Those that could only call and send SMS. I bought a Nokia phone that could **also play mp3s** when I was 14 years old.
    Who would have thought **we could play movies and use internet on those phones** just 10 years later.
    <br><br>
    Artificial Intelligence is now in same level as mobile phones playing mp3s. Or **maybe it already took over the world without knowing us**, as *Life 3.0* story unveils...

## Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Daniel Pink in one of his [PinkCast](http://www.danpink.com/pinkcast) (the best value/time  deal vlogs I know, just ~ 2 minutes) shared a link to book [Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598) by Max Tegmark.

Few more people liked it too, so why not give it a try:

Until then I only thought about artificial intelligence **from Maths and Psychology point of view**, which is great combination but merely enough to understand the topic properly. This book is mix of fiction, utopia, dystopia, number of researches, **with focus on beneficial intelligence**.


### Complex put Simple

Max is skilled in putting complex technical concepts in very simple way.

From DeepMind AI playing Atari games:

to Alpha GO beating the greatest human master in 2016:

## Ask Elon Musk

I knew Elon Musk is making cars and rockets, but I didn't knew he supported non-profit [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org) with [$10M](https://futureoflife.org/2015/10/12/elon-musk-donates-10m-to-keep-ai-beneficial).

## What Will You Do when AI comes?

The book made me think really hard. I tried to answer questions that never occur relevant to me:

- **How I want to focus my career in world, where human tasks get more and more automated?**
- How I want to **raise my child to be adaptable** in the future?

I love this part of book:

"What career advice *should* we give to our kids? I'm encouraging mine to go into professions that machines are currently bad at, and therefore seem unlikely to get automated in the near future.

- Does it require interacting with people and using social intelligence?
- Does it involve creativity and coming up with clever solutions?
- Does it require working in an unpredictable environment?"



## What are my Takeaways?

The books states that every field have **parts that can be easily automated and parts that will take some time**.

And not only in non-IT positions. As a programmer you can:

 - **create e-commerce** one after another,
 - focus on **prediction of nearest next product the customer wants to buy before he knows**.

<br>


I found lot of inspiration and possible blind paths for [RectorPHP](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) project. It's *narrow intelligence*, that upgrades code for you based on your dependencies (I will write about it soon).

If I should apply the same logic as above, **you can be teacher**:

- who **explains news and trends in software for last 2 years**
- or the one who teaches people **how to write a tool, that applies those trends to the code and is usable for next 10 years with minimal work**


<br>

I realized how I underestimate the AI and remembered my (dead) Nokia:

### Reading Protip!

The 2nd half of the book focuses on future of 100+ years. The main focus for me lies in first part: **where are we now, what could happens soon and how can we prepare**.

So if you read first half, you'll get most of this book. Of course, if you like sci-fi stories of harvesting Saturn into circu-planet colony keep on reading.

Happy reading!
