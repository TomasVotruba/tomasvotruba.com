title: "Thank you David Grudl"
perex: |
    While using open-source, we rarely realize that there is one or few people behind it. <strong>People who work in their free time and put an effort in it</strong>.
    We feel like using a product - it should work and when it doesn't, it's broken. And when our application is constantly broken, we will be angry for them.
    <br><br>
    But if our application is smooth and ready, do we love and say thank you?
    <br><br>
    I'd like to express <strong>my gratitude and tribute for you, <a href="https://davidgrudl.com/">David</a> - you made my programming life very joyful and curious experience</strong>.

A great friend of mine [Honza Černý](http://honzacerny.com) lend me a book *[Steal Like An Artist](http://austinkleon.com/steal)* few months ago. I'm very grateful for that, because I don't have much art-people in my social circle. You may think, it's about art (so did I), but it's **more about relationships, sharing, caring, showing your vulnerability and cooperation**. And open-source software!

One of lessons that lead me to this was...

## Write Letters to Your Heroes

> Often when we write fan letters we’re looking for a blessing or an affirmation.
> But if you truly love somebody's work, you shouldn't need a response from them.
> Write a blog post about someone's work that you admire and link to their site.
> Make something and dedicate it to your hero.
> Answer a question they've asked, solve a problem for them or improve their work and share it online.

After reading this, I had my hero in mind, whom I'd like to write. I also shared this though with [Honza Mikeš](https://github.com/JanMikes), who answered me by showing a beautiful thank you email he wrote.

So here is my turn:


## Thank you David

I'd like to really thank you for 3 things you gave me.

## Thank You for My Job

I'm very grateful you've created Nette and you have been taking care of it for the last 10 years. I could work on many interesting web projects, earn a living from it and learn best practise in open-source. I've been maintaining like dozens of packages for a few years and **I could barely remotely imagine, what it takes to maintain one project mostly by yourself. I envy you your huge persistence and determination**.

**Thanks to you, I could bring together 3 things I love the most in the world - people, open-source and education** - and get to teaching, learning and growing a community. I must say it was a relief, because when I was at university, I felt like I could do only programming or only work with people in psychology field.

### It's easy to be a leader, isn't it?

**I remember one moment, when I got much more respect for you.** We had a social training group at university, when me and 15 more schoolmates went to a cottage near Brno to experience social dynamics in games. So there was a boat. And every person on this boat had his or her role and I was chosen to be the captain of the boat.

I thought it must be easy to be a captain (or Nette creator), **because you can tell people what to do and you can decide mostly by yourself**. Oh how hard lesson was about to come. We sailed over the sea, sun was shining, we had enough food and I was looking at my shiny boat and life was great.

Later, we had a hole in our boat, we started to run out of food and we saw some sharks around us - everybody was asking me: "Captain, what should we do? Where do we go? Captain? Captain?" **I felt so much pressure and had thousand of issues to solve**. My head was about to explode. Even though it was just a game.

In that exact moment I realized that every time I needed something to be changed or fixed or explained in Nette, I was putting my responsibility to you. My "I don't care, you do it" approach was very one-sided. **And I started to see how freaking difficult it must be to manage website, community, meetups, program a software, do lectures, learn PHP in-depth and invent new revolutionary approaches in PHP.**

**Deep bow to you for all this and I'm sorry for every bad word I spread about your work online or offline. I'd love to take it back, because now I realize it originated from my in-experience with the other side.**

Since then, I recommend every programmer to maintain an open-source project for half a year to get similar powerful experience.


## Thank you for Joyful Way to Learn PHP

I must say, Nette put a joy to my PHP programming. After all this `$_GET` and `$_POST` putting together in 1 file, I could see there is more advanced software that is mostly intuitive and ready to use.

**Thanks for explaining principals [Dependency Injection in many blog posts](https://phpfashion.com/co-je-dependency-injection)**. I realized how only this thing helped me a lot while designing apps and understanding other frameworks. After travelling around European conferences and meetups, **I see this pattern is very advanced in our country and miles ahead compared to other frameworks - thanks to you**.


## Thank you for Showing me That Programming Can Be Fun

Last but not least, **I really enjoy your talks**. Because they are not usually tech talks - deep, long, boring or complex. **You are very funny and that's what makes you great teacher.**

"They best way to learn something is to learn without knowing it."

I don't know any speaker similar to you who could do such a performance. And also these [puns](https://phpfashion.com/pet-duvodu-upgradovat-na-nette-2-2-3) in the [posts](https://phpfashion.com/jak-vyvijet-komfotrneji). Love it :)

**I consider master peace to combine entertainment and education in one piece. To teach others by making them feel happy.**

Maybe that's the reason I still love Nette and your work, even though I know Symfony on the same level and a bit of Laravel.


## To Sum Up

I just wanted to say a few words to let you know how important you are and how much your work means to me.

No need to reply and enjoy your day!
