title: "9 Steps to Migrate From Jekyll to Statie"
perex: |
    Jekyll is great a way to start static website on Github Pages. But Jekyll has one big problem - the language.
    How would you add custom Twig or Latte filter to Jekyll?
    <br><br>
    I wanted to migrate my static websites from Jekyll to Statie. Can new `init` command make this piece of cake? And what needs to be done next?

## 1. Create Basic Statie Structure

Statie 5.3 brings [new `init` command](/blog/2019/01/07/how-to-create-your-first-php-twig-static-website-under-2-minutes-with-statie/), that creates basic structure in `/source` directory, `statie.yml`, `.travis.yml` and metafiles.

Before we start any moving, create a basic structure to save many copy-pasting steps:

```bash
composer require symplify/statie
vendor/bin/statie init
```

Then, clean `/source` directory from generated files and...

## 2. Move Source files to `/source` Directory

- Jekyll has all the source code in the root.
- Statie works with `/source` directory, so the website is separated from PHP code, tests, metafiles.

```diff
-CNAME
+/source/CNAME
```

```diff
-index.html
+/source/index.html
```

```diff
-_data/projects.yaml
+/source/_data/projects.yaml
```

## 3. Move Parameters Files Under `parameters > [param name]` Sections

**Before** - Jekyll

```yaml
# _data/projects.yaml
-
    name: Symplify
    url: https://github.com/symplify/symplify
```

**After** - Statie

```yaml
# source/_data/projects.yaml
parameters:
    projects:
        -
            name: Symplify
            url: https://github.com/symplify/symplify
```

## 4. Upgrade Absolute Links to Moved Files

```diff
-https://github.com/TomasVotruba/gophp71.org/edit/master/_data/projects.yaml
+https://github.com/TomasVotruba/gophp71.org/edit/master/source/_data/projects.yaml
```

## 5. Load Moved YAML Files in `statie.yml`

```diff
+imports:
+    - { resource: "source/_data/projects.yaml" }
```

## 6. Remove `site.data.` and use Variables Directly

```diff
 <ul>
-    {% for project in site.data.projects %}
+    {% for project in projects %}
         <li><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.name }}</a></li>
     {% endfor %}
 </ul>
```

## 7. Setup Github Pages deploy in Travis

Thanks to `vendor/bin/statie init` you have correctly configured `.travis.yml` in your repository.

To finish deploy, you need to:

- create `gh-pages` branch
- pick it as a source for Github Pages
- generate Github Token
- put it to Travis configuration of your repository

How you do this? Just **follow [Statie.org documentation](https://www.statie.org/docs/github-pages)** step by step.

## 8. Clean Metadata from Headers

In Jekyll, it's required to have `---` section in files, even if empty. You can drop it now:

```diff
- ---
- ---

HTML
...
```

## 9. Run Project Locally

This is what I missed the most at Jekyll page - instant feedback. We want to develop and see output instantly - is it correct or is there a bug?

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

- Then open `localhost:8000` to see your generated HTML.
- Did you edit code in `/source`? → Just **refresh browser to see re-generated HTML**.

This is at least 100 times faster than deploying to Jekyll and checking the output in the production.

That's it! You can enjoy Markdown, Twig and PHP directly from your local machine and still on Github Pages.

Happy coding!
