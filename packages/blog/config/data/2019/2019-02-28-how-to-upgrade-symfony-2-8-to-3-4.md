title: "How to Upgrade Symfony 2.8 to 3.4"
perex: |
    Are you Symfony programmer? Do you work on a successful project? Then upgrading the Symfony project is a work you can't avoid.
    Almost a year ago I wrote about [Five and Half Steps to Migrate from Symfony 2.8 LTS to Symfony 3.4 LTS in Real PRs](https://blog.shopsys.com/5-5-steps-to-migrate-from-symfony-2-8-lts-to-symfony-3-4-lts-in-real-prs-50c98eb0e9f6).
    <br><br>
    Now it's much easier to jump from one LTS to another - with **instant upgrades**.

Recently, more and more issues pop-up at Symfony repository **asking for automated upgrade**:

- [Why not to create a symfony framework updater software from command line](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/30054)

I'm happy Symfony core team is supporting generic solution to all PHP-code upgrades ‚Üì

## Upgrade Symfony... and PHP

To make a bad situation more complicated, this upgrade is also related to upgrading of PHP - **Symfony 3.4 requires PHP 5.5.**

I wrote about [PHP upgrades before](/blog/2018/11/08/fatal-error-uncaught-error-operator-not-supported-for-strings-in/), but the main away is to upgrade **one minor version at once**:

- Symfony 2.8 ‚Üí 3.0
- PHP 5.3 ‚Üí 5.4
- Symfony 3.0 ‚Üí 3.1
- Symfony 3.1 ‚Üí 3.2
- PHP 5.4 ‚Üí 5.5
- Symfony 3.2 ‚Üí 3.3
- Symfony 3.3 ‚Üí 3.4

If you split each of these lines into standalone pull-requests, you're the best!

## Forget `UPGRADE.md`

You probably know I work almost part-time on [the Rector project](https://getrector.org). I gather feedback from conferences and meetups all over Europe and try to make Rector better every day. Recently he also migrated between [2 PHP frameworks](/blog/2019/02/21/how-we-migrated-from-nette-to-symfony-in-3-weeks-part-1/), because why not?

The PHP community gives me really positive vibes about going the right direction. That helps me to make PHP and Symfony **sets more and more complete**:

## How to Upgrade then?

All you need to do to upgrade your PHP code is to install Rector and run particular upgrades.

**Do you want to upgrade from Symfony 2.8 to 3.4?**

```bash
composer require rector/rector --dev
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony28
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony30
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony31
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony32
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony33
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set symfony34
```

You still need to upgrade YAML files, but then you're ready to go.

**Are you stuck on old PHP 5.3?** Rector got you covered:

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set php53
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set php54
vendor/bin/rector process app src --set php55
```

## Awesome Symfony 3.3+ Dependency Injection

Upgrade to Symfony 3.3 shrunk my configs to 1/5 of its original size. That's the  #1 reason you want to upgrade. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check [the diff post about those features](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/). But wait, don't do it manually! **[This tool converts it all](/blog/2018/12/27/how-to-convert-all-your-symfony-service-configs-to-autodiscovery/) for you.**

And that's how we upgrade in 2019 :)

Happy coding!
