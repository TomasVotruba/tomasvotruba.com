title: "Do We Have More than 1024 PHP Groups in The World?"
perex: |
    In April 2018, I started a side project to list meetups in Europe near Prague. **PHP meetups are so much fun**, and I didn't find any single-page with a map that would list them. At the start, this site had a small table, with 10 meetups a month, very *modern* black/white Times New Roman design, and *advanced* human-manual updating.
    <br><br>
    Since then, I got feedback from dozens of friends and users with these WTFs and ideas - they helped me add a feature now and then, polish design with emoji and Bootstrap, **automate everything and even crawl over 150 URLs**. I bought [friendsofphp.org](https://friendsofphp.org) domain, and the project became a single standalone page.
    <br><br>
    Today, it's a much bigger project with over...

...well, see for yourself:

<div class="text-center">
    <a href="https://friendsofphp.org/">
        <img src="/assets/images/posts/2019/friends/preview.png">
    </a>
</div>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    1, 2, 3... <strong>1023 groups</strong>
</blockquote>

I bet there is one group out there that isn't listed yet. It might have a local non-PHP name like ["AFUP" community in France](https://friendsofphp.org/groups/#france).

Whoever finds this group wins üç∫!

## The Most Active Region

I assumed the Czech Republic or Germany is the most active in Europe. I was wrong! Look at Benelux with **over 20 meetups in a month**!

It would be easy to get lost among all these pins, so we put 2 more colors in.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2019/friends/colors-before-after.png" class="img-thumbnail">
    <p>Before ‚Üí After</p>
    <p>
        Traffic lights to save your eyes:
        <strong>
            <span class="text-success">next 7 days</span>
            | <span class="text-warning">next 14 days</span>
            | <span class="text-danger">next 30 days</span>
        </strong>
    </p>
</div>

## 6 More Cool Features

- **Local Storage** - Isn't it annoying to open a map and always see the same location in Europe? What if you're from *complete your country* and you want to see your local meetups only? We got you covered - your last selected location is stored in your browser ‚úÖ

- **Share Your map**
    - "Hey John, check these meetups in Berlin..."
    - "How?"
    - "You have to zoom to this city and..."
    - "Where in Germany is it?"
    - "Oh wait, there is a share button, I'll send you a link."
    - "Awesome" ‚úÖ

- **Locate Yourself** - No need to zoom your country - use your geo-location ‚úÖ. Works great on both laptops and smartphones.

- **Mobile Ready** - While you're traveling, you're (on your) mobile, and you need the meetup fast. The site runs on Bootstrap 4.1 and has hours of testing in different continents and poor connections ‚úÖ

- **Single Site** - No clicking, no menu. Just map and table ‚úÖ

- **Move the Map ‚Üí Table Filters** - See what you need. As you move to the map, the table will transform - it shows you only meetups visible on the map ‚úÖ . Try F5 - local storage still works.

## How Does the Website Work?

Meetups are downloaded every day by Travis CRON job from Meetup.com for each group. You'll find them manually added in [this YAML file in repository](https://github.com/TomasVotruba/friendsofphp.org/blob/master/config/_data/groups.yaml). No surprise **it runs on [Symfony Static Dumper](https://github.com/symplify/symfony-static-dumper) and is fully [open-sourced on Github](https://github.com/tomasvotruba/friendsofphp.org)**.

Although there [Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api) often works as documented, it's impossible to find all PHP groups with it. There is [an issue](https://github.com/meetup/api/issues/249) **when you search for groups in a specific location, it ignores the area and sets back to your origin city**. Pity, that exactly what we need here.

### What now?

Maybe instead of API... a **crawler could help** - [and it did](https://github.com/meetup/api/issues/249#issuecomment-427548572):

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

// crawling Slovenia here: 'https://www.meetup.com/topics/php/si/'
$code = 'si';

$crawlUrl = 'https://www.meetup.com/topics/php/' . $code;
$crawler = new Crawler(file_get_contents($crawlUrl));

$meetupNames = [];
// headlines of found groups
foreach ($crawler->filterXPath('//span[@class="text--bold display--block"]') as $node) {
    $meetupNames[] = $node->textContent;
}

var_dump($meetupNames);
```

After 4 hours of debugging broken API, I got this solution working in roughly 60 minutes.
Provide a list of codes for all countries in the world, and in a few minutes you have with **800 new PHP groups** ‚Üì

    <p>Before ‚Üí After</p>
</div>

   Lesson learned: use what works.

Events are stored with their location and rendered to Open Street Maps with fantastic [Leaflet framework](https://leafletjs.com). You don't have to know any Javascript. Documentation is that good.

## How much Does it Cost to Travel abroad Meetup?

There is [plenty of reasons not-to-go](/blog/2018/07/23/5-signs-should-never-have-a-talk-abroad/) visit PHP meetup abroad, but the one I hear the most **are money**.

To give you an idea, here **are costs of my trips from Prague** to cities nearby:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead class="table-inverse">
        <tr>
            <th class="text-center">City</th>
            <th class="text-center">Travel Time</th>
            <th class="text-center">Travel $</th>
            <th class="text-center">Stay $</th>
            <th class="text-center">Total $</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.meetup.com/PHP-USERGROUP-DRESDEN/">Dresden</a></td>
        <td>2 hours</td>
        <td>20 ‚Ç¨ </td>
        <td>~ <span class="text-muted">(go home the same day)</span></td>
        <td class="text-right"><strong>20 ‚Ç¨</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/">Vienna</a></td>
        <td>5 hours</td>
        <td>30 ‚Ç¨ </td>
        <td>30 ‚Ç¨ AirBnb / 0 $ friend from meetup</td>
        <td class="text-right"><strong>30-60 ‚Ç¨</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-PHP-Usergroup/">Berlin</a></td>
        <td>5 hours</td>
        <td>50 ‚Ç¨</td>
        <td>40 ‚Ç¨ AirBnb / 0 $ friend from meetup</td>
        <td class="text-right"><strong>40-90 ‚Ç¨</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

At the start, I had to pay Airbnb. But when you go to meetups more than once, you'll remember people; they'll remember you, and they're beneficial with your subsequent visits. ** ask to stay over for one night on the floor**.
