perex: |
    Since Symplify 7.3, you might notice a few deprecation notices in your coding standards. As Symplify 8 release is [synced with Symfony cycle](/blog/2017/10/30/what-can-you-learn-from-menstruation-and-symfony-releases/), both will be released at the end of May.

    Updated ECS YAML to PHP configuration since **ECS 8**.

When you run [ECS](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard) with version 7.3+:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check
```

You might see such notices right before your code gets checked:

```bash
PHP Notice:  Sniff "..." is deprecated. Use "..." instead
```

## Why were These Sniffs Dropped?

Symplify 7 used lots of sniffs based on coding standard [tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.token-get-all.php). In time they were made, they were as good. [Tokens are best at spaces, abstract syntax tree is best at logical code structure](/blog/2018/10/25/why-ast-fixes-your-coding-standard-better-than-tokens/#shifting-the-scope).

E.g. `TraitNameSniff` check name of traits and makes sure the name ends with "Trait":

```php
<?php

// hey, this should be "ProductTrait"
trait Product
{
}
```

Do you see any spaces or token positions? No, it's just:

- find a trait
- check its name

So writing this rule in tokens is the wrong tool chosen. Why? With tokens, you need to make sure:

- trait token is found
- there are no spaces after trait token
- detect the name
- for other rules, resolve its fully qualified name based on the namespace and use imports (real hell with tokens)

But **why waste time on re-inventing the wheel**, when we can use a tool that handles tedious work for us?
It's better to use *abstract syntax tree* technology, in this case [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org).

<br>

**That's why** all the "AST" sniffs were migrated to PHPStan rules.

## What to do With These Deprecations?

So what does it mean? Remove all the rules from `ecs.php` and let go?

No, **all you need to do is switch to PHPStan rules**. It's better working and more reliable since it works with context and not token positions. So at first, you might discover a few new reported errors here and there.


## How to Handle Upgrade in 1 hour?

There are 14 deprecated sniffs in total. Don't worry, while it might seem like a considerable number, the replacement is a matter of an hour.

Have you used a full Symplify set?

```php

// ecs.php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;
use Symplify\EasyCodingStandard\Configuration\Option;use Symplify\EasyCodingStandard\ValueObject\Set\SetList;

return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $parameters = $containerConfigurator->parameters();
    $parameters->set(Option::SETS, [SetList::SYMPLIFY]);
};
```

Then you won't see any deprecations, because rules were removed from the config for you.
Still, I recommend adding these rules to `phpstan.neon`.

## 1. Abstract, Trait and Interface Naming Sniffs

These rules were removed:

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Naming\AbstractClassNameSniff`~~
- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Naming\TraitNameSniff`~~
- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Naming\InterfaceNameSniff`~~

and replaced by:

‚Üì

```bash
composer require --dev slam/phpstan-extensions
```

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - SlamPhpStan\ClassNotationRule
```

## 2. Cognitive Complexity

The [only ~~sniff~~ rule your coding standard should have](/blog/2018/05/21/is-your-code-readable-by-humans-cognitive-complexity-tells-you/)... just got better.

The orifinal sniffs were removed:

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\CognitiveComplexitySniff`~~
- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\ClassCognitiveComplexitySniff`~~

and replaced by more avanced AST in form of PHPStan rules:

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
includes:
    - vendor/symplify/coding-standard/packages/cognitive-complexity/config/cognitive-complexity-rules.neon

# if you use default value, you can skip this section
parameters:
    symplify:
        max_cognitive_complexity: 10
        max_class_cognitive_complexity: 60
```

## 3. Make sure Classes used in @param, @var and @return Exists

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Commenting\AnnotationTypeExistsSniff`~~

Just drop it. PHPStan level 0 handles this.

## 4. Forbidden Static ‚Üí Explicit Static

Static functions [are best way to slowly create technical dept](/blog/2019/04/01/removing-static-there-and-back-again/). But sometimes it's tough to code without them.

So instead of forbidding them:

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\ForbiddenStaticFunctionSniff`~~

‚Üì

Just be honest about them:

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\NoClassWithStaticMethodWithoutStaticNameRule
```

The same way you see a "trait" in a file name and know it's a trait,
this rule makes sure that classes with static methods have "static" in its name.

I've been using it for 4 days, and oh, what a shame I feel when I want to use a "Static" "service". It **makes me think twice both about the design and consequences**.

## 5. Forbidden Parent Class

Even though it's repeated over, again and again, that composition beats inheritance, the PHP code I see is full of it.

Sometimes the only way to [promote so-far-the-best practise](/blog/2017/10/16/how-to-use-repository-with-doctrine-as-service-in-symfony/), is to enforce it.

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\ForbiddenParentClassSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\ForbiddenParentClassRule

parameters:
    symplify:
        forbidden_parent_classes:
            - 'Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository'
```

## 6. Use Custom Exceptions over Basic Ones

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Architecture\ExplicitExceptionSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\NoDefaultExceptionRule
```

## 7. Prefer One Class over Another

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Architecture\PreferredClassSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
parameters:
    symplify:
        old_to_preffered_classes:
            DateTime: 'Nette\Utils\DateTime'

rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\PreferredClassRule
```

## 8. No Duplicated Short Classes

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Architecture\DuplicatedClassShortNameSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\NoDuplicatedShortClassNameRule
```

## 9. Use explicit Return over `&` Reference

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\ForbiddenReferenceSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\NoReferenceRule
```

## 10. Don't leave `dump()` Function in the Code

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Debug\DebugFunctionCallSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\NoDebugFuncCallRule
```

## 11. Respect Naming of Your Parents

- ~~`Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\Naming\ClassNameSuffixByParentSniff`~~

‚Üì

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\ClassNameRespectsParentSuffixRule

parameters:
    symplify:
        parent_classes:
            - Rector
```

And that's it! You've just migrated all deprecated sniffs to PHPStan rules. Upgrade to Symplify 8 will be a piece of cake for you.
