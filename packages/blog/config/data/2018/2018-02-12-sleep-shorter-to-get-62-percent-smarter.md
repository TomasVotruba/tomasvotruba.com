title: "Sleep Shorter to Get 62 % Smarter"
perex: |
    Even though I see [University as very poor place to learn something useful](/blog/2017/11/13/7-tips-you-should-know-before-going-to-university/), I studied Psychology in Brno for 3 years.
    <br><br>
    *Psychological Impacts of Polyphasic Sleep* is the topic of my [bachelor thesis](https://is.muni.cz/th/363896/fss_b/Tomas-Votruba-Psychological-Impacts-of-Polyphasic-Sleep.pdf) I wrote in 2012. In the end it gave me clear answer to question: **can we sleep less than 4,5 hours a night to get smarter?**

## From 6 to 4,5 hours of Sleep in 3 Months

I switched from monophasic sleep schedule (6 hours in a row) to **Everyman 3** (4,5 hours in a row + 3 naps during the day) for **3 months** and tested myself daily in attention span, short term memory and working memory.


To give you the idea **how polyphasic sleep can look like**:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/polyphasic-charts.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">

    <em>blue = sleep, yellow = awake</em>
</div>

<br>

And this is how my real sleep schedule looked like:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/phase-b.png" class="img-thumbnail">

<br>

On average, I slept **3.78 times a day** with **4.48 hours in total**.

## 62 % Better Short Term Memory

**One of hypothesis was that short term memory improves**. It was measured by table of random-generated list of words I had to remember during 2 minutes and then type back in next 60 seconds:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/short-term.png" class="img-thumbnail">

<br>

I remembered much more of these words on polyphasic sleep:

<table class="table table-bordered table-responsive">
    <thead class="thead-inverse">
        <tr>
            <th>Sleep Schedule</th>
            <th>Words Recalled</th>
            <th>Improvement to Monophasic</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Monophasic</td>
        <td>12.82 words</td>
        <td>&ndash;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Polyphasic (Phase 3)</td>
        <td>20.66 words</td>
        <td>+62 %</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Polyphasic (Phase 4)</td>
        <td>16.96 words</td>
        <td>+32 %</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>

And in linear regression:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/short-term-linear-regression.png" class="img-thumbnail">

    <em>Phase 3: first half of polyphasic period, Phase 4: second half of polyphasic period"</em>
</div>

<br>

## 23 % Better Working Memory

Another test measured time that takes to click whole path from the lowest to the highest letter and number (A, 1, B, 2...):

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/line.png" class="img-thumbnail">

<br>

<table class="table table-bordered table-responsive">
    <thead class="thead-inverse">
        <tr>
            <th>Sleep Schedule</th>
            <th>Path Duration</th>
            <th>Change to Monophasic</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Monophasic</td>
        <td>32.58 s</td>
        <td>&ndash;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Polyphasic (Phase 3)</td>
        <td>25.07 s</td>
        <td><strong>+ 30 %</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Polyphasic (Phase 4)</td>
        <td>27.73 s</td>
        <td><strong>+ 17 %</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>

And in linear regression:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/polyphasic/line-linear-regression.png" class="img-thumbnail">

    <em>Phase 3: first half of polyphasic period, Phase 4: second half of polyphasic period"</em>
</div>


<br>

The very similar **improvement 23 %** was in [Group Bourdon Test](https://www.jobtestprep.co.uk/group-bourdon-test). It is **standard for driver licences** and tests attention, pattern recognition and **concentration for long period of time** (related to so precious [deep work](/blog/2017/09/25/3-non-it-books-that-help-you-to-become-better-programmer/#deep-work-by-cal-newport)).

Just select all 4-dots images:

## Win-Win

Not all hypothesis were confirmed. But even though I was ill in phase 4 (see section 5.2), the results were more then clear**. Polyphasic sleep improved my attention, working memory and short term memory from 23 % to 63 %**.

And not only that. And **I also got extra 1,5 hours a day**!


## Polyphasic Sleep - Universal Tool to Boost Production?

It depends on what you need in your life. I needed time to produce because I got many time-demanding goals in that time. In time I learned to prioritize, to focus on what is important and to flow in a deep works session.

I still take a nap roughly once a week and feel fresh, when day is hard. And if I ever be father of another baby, I'd be happy to polyphase with him or her, since it's babies natural sleep schedule.

## Do you Need More Time? Try it

Would you use extra hour a day? Have you tried it? Nap a day won't hurt and you don't even have to fall asleep. Modern medicine confirms that mindfulness meditation (which polyphasic sleep often is) has great benefits for your mind.


### Where is What in Thesis?

I picked the most interesting parts for you, so you can avoid [reading whole 63 pages](https://is.muni.cz/th/363896/fss_b/Tomas-Votruba-Psychological-Impacts-of-Polyphasic-Sleep.pdf) and go right to the part that you're interested in:

- 4.4 *Hypothesis* - what needs to be validated
- 4.5 *Materials* - test battery, how it looked like, what exactly is measured
- 5 *Results* - numbers, graphs
- 6 *Discussion* - looking at numbers from perspective, why and what actually happened


### Do you have question to specific part of the thesis?

Just go to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gTjk_q403nt9nhqZTo9gsHFB8oZGz_-YpKDJV-ekow/edit?usp=sharing) version and ask in comment there.

Happy napping!
