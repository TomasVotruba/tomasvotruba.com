title: "Your Most Favorite Posts in 2018"
perex: |
    It's a holiday, we want to rest and enjoy time with our families. Hence I won't bother you with a complex topic, but finish this year with the simple post instead. A post about the most read post in 2018.

    **Was it Symfony? Doctrine? PHP or...**

Without further ado, these are stats **for unique readers** from Google Analytics for 2018:

<div class="text-center pt-3">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/top-posts/pie.png" class="mr-5">

    <strong><span class="bigger">3 posts = 31,4 % of readers</span></strong>

## You Read a Crazy Lot

I'm very happy that you don't just open, copy-paste and bounce away. You actually read - and not just a few paragraphs. Your reading times are almost equal to times to read the whole post. **You read from the start to the end**, which is amazing!

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/top-posts/time.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</div>

As I said, this would be quick and right to the point... unless you're reading one of those top 5 now and never got here :).

I'll do my best to make this blog the best know-how source.

See you next year!
