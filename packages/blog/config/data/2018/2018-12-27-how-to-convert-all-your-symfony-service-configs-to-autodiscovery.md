    Do you use Symfony autodiscovery services registration everywhere and your configs have no extra lines?
    Skip this post and rather read another one.

    But if **you have many configs with manual service registration**, tagging, and autowiring, keep reading. I'll show you how you can convert them easily be new Symplify package.

## tl;dr;

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/autodiscovery/demo.gif" class="img-thumbnail">

<br>

I've been consulting a few Symfony e-commerce projects recently that all have `service.yml`. Big configs with manual service registration:

```yaml
services:
    App\SomeService:
        autowire: true

    App\Controller\SomeController:
        autowire: true

    # 50 more lines...
    # 20 more files similar to this one
```

I already wrote [How to refactor to new Dependency Injection features in Symfony 3.3](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/), so you can read it. But you don't have to, since **this conversion can be automated**...

```yaml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
    App\:
        resource: /src
```

...with [Symplify\Autodiscovery](https://github.com/symplify/autodiscovery).

## 3 Steps to Your Minimalistic Configs

1. Install the package

    ```bash
    composer require symplify/autodiscovery
    ```

2. Convert Configs

    Run on `/src` directory:

    ```diff
    vendor/bin/autodiscovery convert-yaml /src
    ```

    It converts all `services.yml`, `config.yml`, `config.dev.yml` etc. configs that contain `services:` to autodiscovery format.

    `*.yaml` included.

3. See the changes:

    ```bash
    git diff
    ```

## What Can Go Wrong?

There are many reasons to **automate this work**, because **there are many gotchas** you have to be careful about. In each single service registration.

## 1. Tags

Name-only system tags **can be removed** thanks to `autoconfigure`:

```diff
 services:
-    first_command:
-        class: App\Command\FirstCommand
-        tags:
-            - { name: 'console.command' }
-
-    second_command:
-        class: App\Command\SecondCommand
-        tags: ['console.command']
+    _defaults:
+        autoconfigure: true
+
+     App\Command\:
+         resource: '../src/Command'
```

But you have to **keep** [lazy-loaded commands](https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/commands_as_services.html#lazy-loading)

```yaml
services:
    first_command:
        class: App\Command\FirstCommand
        tags:
          - { name: 'console.command', command: 'first' }
```

And tags with metadata:

```yaml
services:
    App\EventListener\ExceptionListener:
        tags:
            - { name: 'kernel.event_listener', event: 'kernel.exception' }
```

## 2. Single-class Names

Service name can be often dropped:

```diff
 services:
-    app.controller:
-        class: App\SomeController
+    App\SomeController: ~
```

Except for classes with no namespace:

```yaml
services:
    Single_Class_Name:
        class: Single_Class_Name
```

## 3. Vendor Autodiscovery

Configs are usually mixed of your code (`/app` or `/src`) and 3rd party code (`/vendor`):

```yaml
# old config
services:
    App\SomeService: ~
    App\AnotherService: ~

    Symplify\PackageBuilder\Parameter\ParameterProvider: ~
    Symplify\PackageBuilder\FileSystem\FileGuard: ~
```

Seeing this you have to think about that. If not, you might accidentally apply autodiscovery everywhere:

```diff
 services:
-    App\SomeService: ~
-    App\AnotherService: ~
+    App\:
+        resource: ../src

-    Symplify\PackageBuilder\Parameter\ParameterProvider: ~
-    Symplify\PackageBuilder\FileSystem\FileGuard: ~
+    Symplify\PackageBuilder\: ~
+        resource: ../vendor/symplify/package-builder/src
```

Ops, the last case should not be converted - **all 3rd party classes have to be explicit** since they're handled by their own config/bundle in `/vendor`:

```yaml
services:
    Symplify\PackageBuilder\Parameter\ParameterProvider: ~
    Symplify\PackageBuilder\FileSystem\FileGuard: ~
```

## 4. Exclude Obviously

When you try to autoload a class with a constructor, it's considered a service. But not all classes with constructors are services. Symfony doesn't know that unless you tell it, and it would fail with missing argument exception.

```diff
 services:
     App\:
        resource: ../src
+       exclude:
+           - ../src/Entity/*
+           - ../src/Exception/*
+           - ../src/Contract/*
```

The converter includes support for basic dirs to be excluded.
