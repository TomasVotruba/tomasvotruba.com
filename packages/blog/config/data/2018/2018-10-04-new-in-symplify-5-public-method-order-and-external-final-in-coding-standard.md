## 3. Final for 3rd Party Classes

If you're strict enough to `final` or `abstract` everywhere, you'll love this. Sometimes 3rd party code is not `final`, but you'd love to never see that class in your code - Abstract Controller, Abstract Doctrine Repository or Abstract Object.

Those `abstract` classes are full of **magic everyone has to [remember](/blog/2018/08/27/why-and-how-to-avoid-the-memory-lock/)**. What if you could **prevent that spreading to your code without constant code-reviews**?

Let PHPStan rule do the job:

```yaml
# phpstan.neon
rules:
    - Symplify\CodingStandard\Rules\ForbiddenParentClassRule

parameters:
    symplify:
        forbidden_parent_classes:
            - 'Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository'
            - 'Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\Repository\ServiceEntityRepository'
```

This will prevent over-inheritance and embrace composition - like in [Repositories as Services](/blog/2017/10/16/how-to-use-repository-with-doctrine-as-service-in-symfony/) approach:

<em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-lg"></em>

```php
<?php

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;

final class ProductRepository extends EntityRepository
{
}
```
<em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-lg"></em>

```php
<?php

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;

final class ProductRepository
{
    /**
     * @var EntityRepository
     */
    private $entityRepository;

    public function __construct(EntityRepository $entityRepository)
    {
        $this->entityRepository = $entityRepository;
    }
}
```

<br>

That's all folks. Happy sniffing!
