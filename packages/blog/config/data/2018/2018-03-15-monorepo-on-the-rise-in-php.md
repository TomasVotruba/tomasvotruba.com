    Do you know what a monorepo is? How to start with it? What you need and do even other programming languages use it? And what about Facebook and Google think about it?

## Javascript, Java, C++, Android, iOS, Facebook, Google? Monorepo is Standard

When you pop out of PHP bubble, you can see in [awesome-monorepo](https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo) a collection of monorepo tools, that are used out in a wild by another languages. Google has [Bazel](https://bazel.build), Facebook has [Buck](https://buckbuild.com), Twitter and Foursqaure have [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org).

**Still a PHP-related tool is missing**. Why? It might be the case, that no global company that goes open-source uses PHP as their main language.

## Symfony Monorepo Spreads the Word

PHP is aware of monorepo term mainly thanks to [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony), that uses it to maintain **all its components, that are split to standalone** read-only repositories, e.g. [Symfony\Console](https://github.com/symfony/console), [Symfony\EventDispatcher](https://github.com/symfony/event-dispatcher).

### Tool to Split With

Since Symfony needed a fast tool to split over 30 repositories across 3 and more branches, Fabien Potencier came with [splits](https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/739860138564149248?lang=en) tool.

He also had a [very interesting talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w3-f6Xhvu8) ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/fabpot/a-monorepo-vs-manyrepos)), where he explains in details, how Symfony monorepo works, what is splitting and what are the needs for a build tool managing monorepo.

**But it's still to complex to start with and it doesn't cover the most common case - building monorepo from already existing repositories**.

## Shopsys Monorepo to Spread a bit more Word

I work on [Shopsys Framework](https://www.shopsys.com), an open-source e-commerce platform on Symfony and the monorepo topic finally came to the sprint to be realized. If you've read until now, **you know there is not much shared know-how or support for new-commers to adopt a monorepo pattern in PHP**.

That's how [`shopsys/monorepo-tools`](https://github.com/shopsys/monorepo-tools), that covers both build and split was given birth by [Petr Heinz](https://github.com/PetrHeinz).

It's slowly getting better with monorepo in PHP. But still many people don't know what is difference between *a monorepo* and *a monolith*.
