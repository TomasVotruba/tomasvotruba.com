You don't have this package installed yet?

```bash
composer require symplify/easy-coding-standard --dev
```

Now enjoy the news â†“

## 1. Friendlier Skips

<a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/948/files" class="btn btn-dark btn-sm">
    <em class="fab fa-github fa-fw"></em>
    See pull-request #948
</a>

Little details make more pleasant developer experience UX. You already know **you can use  [`fnmatch()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) for skipping files**. The problem is, it requires very specific format people struggle with and often end up using explicit 10 paths to many files.

**Before** you had to hit the format:

```php
<?php

// ecs.php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;
use Symplify\EasyCodingStandard\ValueObject\Option;

return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $parameters = $containerConfigurator->parameters();

    $parameters->set(Option::SKIP, [
        SomeFixer::class => [
            // this worked
            '*src/*CaseConverter.php',

            // this didn't work
            'src/*CaseConverter.php',
        ]]
    );
};

```

**Now** you can use your intuition, copy paste the filename from error result and both versions work.

## 2. In Lazy We Trust

<a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/832/files" class="btn btn-dark btn-sm">
    <em class="fab fa-github fa-fw"></em>
    See pull-request #832
</a>

**Before** you had to type the whole config name and use YAML:

```bash
easy-coding-standard.yaml
easy-coding-standard.yml
```

As you've already noticed, **now** you can use short version with **normal PHP - `ecs.php`**:

## 3. Are There Some "array" Checkers?

<a href="https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/967/files" class="btn btn-dark btn-sm">
    <em class="fab fa-github fa-fw"></em>
    See pull-request #967
</a>

Many people asked for an overview of all checkers there are, if there any related to an array, to `strict_types` position and so on.

**Before** you had to go to huge `README.md` files of PHP CS Fixer and PHP_CodeSniffer on Github to read it all. But **why leave the luxury of CLI if these checkers are already downloaded** on your machine?

**Now** you can use "find" command:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/symplify-5-ecs/find.gif" class="img-thumbnail">

Next time you'll wonder what are "Symplify" rules, keep your browser closed and just find them:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs find symplify
```

Enjoy laziness, intuitive use and faster access to the information you look for.

We'll continue to make it this way!
