        <p>
            Would you like to learn about Rector, Symfony, Monorepo or PHPStan in fast and practical way? I organize trainings to pass distilled knowledge to you. From 16 years of experience in single day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trainings are practical - we code, <strong>everyone codes</strong>. Not just for ourselves but against CI. Don't worry, my job is to help you make the CI green and understand why it broke. <strong>In the end you'll have the confidence to code yourself</strong>.
