        <p>
            Would you like to learn about Rector, Symfony, Monorepo or PHPStan in a fast and practical way? I organize trainings to pass distilled knowledge from 16 years of experience in couple of days.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the training we code together, learn from mistakes and their understanding. My goal is to <strong>build your confidence to the limit</strong> when you don't me. You'll be able to build anything from the training yourself.
