    Last week I wrote about [top 5 bloghacks](/blog/2018/04/12/the-best-5-of-256-bloghacks-book/) I found in this book.
    <br>
    Today I'll share with you **5 tips that proven useful during my programming/self-education career**.

## 1. Make Your Post Ideas Public

This is another place where open-source beats closed-source:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/blogtips/github-issues.png" alt="Github issues with posts idea as issues" class="img-thumbnail">

<br>

All my post ideas public and community can up-vote it, down-vote it, comment there or **add your own idea**:

### How to Use It?

- Do you hear the same question over and over again? Put it there.
- Do you think it's great idea to write about "Repositories in Symfony"? Put it there.
- When I want to write, I'll just look there, let my hearth pick the one that's closest to it's setting at the moment and start writing.

And it's not only for writing itself, but also for preparation. **You can put also concepts there, ask people for details or up-vote it every time you see question about it**. The post content grows without you knowing it.

### Keep it Fit and Slim

I got inspired at [Ocramius's blog issues](https://github.com/Ocramius/ocramius.github.com/issues), where is over 20 ideas now. I tried the same approach - add every idea I have. I end up having 30+ great ideas and **with [choice paralysis](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnalysisParalysisOverthinkingAndKnowingTooMuchToJustCODE.aspx) every time I wanted to blog**.

Then I remembered the healing effect of minimalism on [open-source mental health](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/) and **set myself a limit of 10 ideas maximum**. I still drop ideas here and there and from time to time check the count. **If it's > 10, I pick top 10 and delete the rest - ruthlessly.**

## 2. Write About Pain Points You Meet

**Every one of us has passion for something**. It might be quiet due to [school silence treatment](/blog/2018/03/22/how-teaching-suicides-itself-by-killing-the-passion/), it might be unclear to see and maybe you think about yourself, that you have nothing to extra to add to this world that hasn't been added yet. You're probably wrong.

**If you're a programmer, you have passion for some pattern, or framework, of the way you create your code. It might be clean code, it might be Laravel, it might be passion for this new package, or complex algorithm.**

And when you meet opposite in your life, you just feel it.

For me it's clearly: **static, services locators vs. constructor and dependency injection first**.

In every [Symplify](https://github.com/symplify/symplify) package and [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) I'm trying to put constructor injection first. It's often super hard and takes lof of [refactoring](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/693) and thinking, but I go for it because I see that DI absence is the main pillar of legacy code.

### It's About You

But this is not about me. **It's about you.** **Find your topic that makes your heart racing - either from being happy or from being angry.** Readers will know and will react to it. You'll reach their passion by sharing yours. And it's also very deep source of your inner knowledge. You can write this new feature in Symfony, but that's written, done and finished. But if you write about your passion, there will always be a topic to write about, to explore.

## 3. Write Compliments about Others

- *How to Setup ...?*
- *5 New Features in ...?*
- *3 Reasons to Install ... on Your Android?*
- *4 Ways to Save Time by using ...?*

Almost every programming post is like this. Everyone is writing about themselves, their products or how to use this or that software. A software.

But thanks to all the coding, programming and algorithms we almost forgot about the most important thing in the world - yes the good old offline world: **relations ships**.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center mt-5 mb-5">
    "You can have everything in life you want,<br>
    if you will just help other people get what they want."
    <footer class="blockquote-footer">Zig Ziglar</footer>
</blockquote>

This quote get more true every year I get older.

Such an expression of random gratitude will shine in the world of social networks. For inspiration:

- [Thank You David](/blog/2017/06/01/thank-you-david/)

- [Kolik lidí je potřeba k vytvoření jedné komunity?
](/blog/2016/03/03/kolik-lidi-je-potreba-k-vytvoreni-jedne-komunity/) (in Czech)

Or just start slowly:

- Be nice about concurrency package - [Symplify packages deprecations brought by Symfony 3.3](/blog/2017/05/29/symplify-packages-deprecations-brought-by-symfony-33/)

- Say "thank you" [to a friend who lend you a book](/blog/2018/04/12/the-best-5-of-256-bloghacks-book/#4-put-a-search-on-website) you review. And [again to another friend](/blog/2017/09/25/3-non-it-books-that-help-you-to-become-better-programmer/#steal-like-and-artist-by-austing-kleon).

Your love expressed to others will eventually get back to you, don't worry :).

## 4. But More Importantly, Be Yourself

I've read a lot of book and tips about writing but when you step back, it's often how the *write would do it to enjoy it*. So my last tip for your is to be yourself, write about your topics, use your style. That's the thing you're naturally the best in the worlds.

Have an awesome summer day!
