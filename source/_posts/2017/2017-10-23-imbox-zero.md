My huge inspiration [Leo Babauta](https://zenhabits.net/) has [popularized](https://zenhabits.net/email-zen-clear-out-your-inbox/) Inbox Zero [concept](https://zenhabits.net/email-sanity/) of **having 0 emails after every visit of your inbox**. 

All emails are resolved, postponed (will return in 5 days) or archived:

**The less noise you let to your brain, the better and [deeper your can focus](/blog/2017/09/25/3-non-it-books-that-help-you-to-become-better-programmer/#deep-work-by-cal-newport) on single task**. 

<br>

The state you try to avoid is called *cognitive overflow*:

This applies to email.


## What is Zero IM-box then?

Ever since smartphones went viral, it is common to have **7 SMS on single display. 1 new, 6 already resolved**. 
That would be ok, if you're used to full inbox, where your brain is programmed to filter the noise. **But not if you're appling inbox zero method**.

That is my case too and **I was tired of having 2 contradictive approaches** in my brain.

<br>

**So I've tried to archive all messages.**

And it works like a charm. My ability to response sms rise and blood pressure from switching visual modes decreases :)


## Give Your Brain a Comfort Spa 

Now it's much easier for me to:

- **remember what to resolve**
- **know who to response**
- approach sms just few times a day **in chunks** - just like in Google Inbox
- and resolve messages **more quickly**


And you don't have to stop at SMS. I talk about smartphones, remember?

**[Messenger](https://messenger.com)**

**WhatsApp**

Same rules applied, same profit got ;)

## Gain for Brains

Once I've read [The Universe in a Nutshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universe_in_a_Nutshell) by this guy Stephen Hawking in my before-teenage days. I still remember single quote from it: 

<blockquote class="blockquote">
    "Think in structures."
</blockquote>

I didn't know what that means, but my dad talked nicely about Steve, so I though he might be a smart guy - so tried to. In our use case, **instead of having 2 algorithms to resolve incoming message, we will have 1**. Thus having more neurons to do job we need them to do thanks to neuroplasticity. 

Like finding a good coffee anywhere you are :)

<br>

Happy thinking!
