title: "Thank you David"
perex: '''
    While using open-source, we rarely realize there is one or few persons behind it. <strong>Who put free time, effort and work in it</strong>.
    We feel like using a product - it should work and when it doesn't, it's broken. And when our application is constantly broken, we will be angry for them.
    <br><br>
    But if our application is smooth and ready, do we love and say thank you?
    <br><br>
    I'd like to express <strong>my gratitude and tribute for you, David - you made my programming life very joyful and curious experience</strong>.

A great friend of mine [Honza Černý](http://honzacerny.com/) lend me a book *[Steal Like An Artist](http://austinkleon.com/steal/)* few months ago. I'm very grateful for that, because I don't have much art-people in my social circle. You may think, it's about art (so did I), but it's **more about relationships, sharing, caring, showing your vulnerability and cooperation**. And open-source software!

One of lessons that lead me to this was...

## Write Letters to Your Heroes
 
> A lot of times when we write fan letters we’re looking for a blessing or an affirmation. 
> But if you truly love somebody's work, you shouldn't need a response from them.
> Write a blog post about someone's work that you admire and link to their site. 
> Make something and dedicate it to your hero. 
> Answer a question they've asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online.

After reading this, I had my hero in mind, whom I'd like to write. I also shared this though with [Honza Mikeš](https://github.com/Lexinek), who answered me by showing a beautiful thank you email he wrote.

So here is my turn:


## Thank you David

I'd like to really thank you for 3 things you gave me.

## Thank you for my job 
 
I'm very grateful you've created Nette and take care of it for last 10 years. I could work on many interesting web projects, earn a living from it and learn best practise in open-source. I've maintained like dozens of packages for a few years and **I could barely remotely imagine, what it takes to maintain one project mostly by yourself. I envy you your huge persistence and determination**.

**Thanks to you, I could join 3 things I love the most in the worlds - people, open-source and education** - and get to teaching, learning and growing a community. I must say it was a relief, because when I was at university, I felt like I could do only programming or only work with people in psychology field. 

### It's easy to be leader, or not?

I remember one moment, when I got much respect for you. Once we had a social training group, when me and 15 more schoolmates went to a cottage near Brno to experience social dynamics in games. There was a boat. And every person on this boat had it's role. We discussed in a group who would be sailor, who would be a navigator and who would be a captiain.

I though it must be easy to be a captain (or Nette creator), because you can tell people what to do and you can decide mostly by yourself. Oh how hard lesson was about to come. We sailed over the sea, sun was shining, we had enough food and I was looking at my shiny boat with huge happy crazy. And life was great. So far. 

Suddenly, navigator noticed trees on a horizon - there was a land. Feeling of joy and excitement washed over the crew. And life was great.
 
Then, a steersman started to feeling sick and had to lay down. How do we get without steersman to the land? I quickly find very skillful replacement. And life was good.
 
In few following minutes - we had a hole in our boat, we started to run out of food and we spot some sharks underneath ask. Everybody was asking me: "Captain, what should we do? Where do we go? Captain? Captain?" I felt so much pressure and had thousand of issues to solve. My head was about to explode. Even if it was a game.

In that exact moment, that everytime I needed something to be changed or fixed or explained in Nette, I'm putting my responsibility to you. I realized my "I don't care, you do it" approach was very one-sided. And I started to realize, it must be freaking difficult to manage website, community, meetups, program a software, do lectures, learn PHP in-depth and invent new revolutionary approaches in PHP.   

Deep bow to you for all this and I'm sorry for every bad word I spread about your work online or offline. I'd love to take it back, because I realize it originated from my in-experience with the other side. 


Since then, I recommend every programmer to maintain a open-source project for half a year to get similar powerful experience.
  

### Thank you for joyful way to learn PHP

I must say, Nette put a joy to my PHP programming. After all this `$_GET` and `$_POST` putting together in 1 file, I could see there is more advanced software that is mostly intuitive and ready to use.

Thanks for explaining principals [Dependency Injection in many blog posts](https://phpfashion.com/co-je-dependency-injection). I realized how only this thing helped me a lot while designing apps and understanding other frameworks. I see this pattern is very advanced in our country and miles ahead compared to other frameworks, after travelling around european Conferences and Meetups. 


### Thanky you for showing me, that programming can be fun

Last but not least, I really enjoyed your talks. Because they were not usually tech talks - deep, long, boring or too complex. You are very funny and that's what makes you great teacher. "They best way to learn anything is to start without knowing it."
I don't know any speaker similar to you, who could do such a performance. And also these puns in the posts. Love it :)

I consider master peace to combine entertainment and education in one piece. To teach others be making them happy. I see many people, who are funny and can create a lot of content, which many people want to see, but there is not much change in their lives. Or teachers or rather programmers, who have so many to say and share about life, but don't quite create a connection with they listeners.
  
 I personally struggle with this every day and try to learn this. And you act with such humillity and lightness.
 
 Maybe that's the reason I still love Nette and your work, even when I know Symfony on the same level and bit of Laravel. 
 
 
 Well, I just wanted to say you few words, just so you know, how important your work and you is for me.
 
 
 No need to reply and enjoy your day! :)
