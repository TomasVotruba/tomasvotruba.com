te letters to your heroes
A lot of times when we write fan letters we’re looking for a blessing or an affirmation. But if you truly love somebody’s work, you shouldn’t need a response from them. Write a blog post about someone’s work that you admire and link to their site. Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they’ve asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online.
