    There is no need - as <a href="https://github.com/Lexinek">Honza Mikes</a> said - to <em>bring the wood to the forest</em>. So they were deprecated.

    I will show <strong>why and what packages were deprecated and how to upgrade your app

I will give you some insight behind deprecations first. It was not instant decision based on few Symfony blog posts,
but community, feedback and intuition inspired long process to mature.
 
If you only want to see before/after changes in you application, you can [skip right to the code](#a-href-https-github-com-deprecatedpackages-defaultautowire-defaultautowire-a). 


## Bringing The Wood to the Forest in Open Source

One of motivations to create and build open-source project is <strong>competition</strong>. You wan't to create better software
than there already is, to push the society further in the development. If my project is the best, there is much less motivation to develop it.

That's why it's the best to have **2 elements of similar level so they push each other forward**, like:
Google & Facebook, USA & Russia, Symfony & Laravel or PHP & Javascript (in a way).

## Swallowing My Open-Source Ego
 
When [Symfony 3.3 introduced new Dependency Injection features](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/),
I realized they're 90 % similar to feature I created my packages for.
 to

Internal dialog of my Ego and inner Zen master started:

- "It's still not the same, I should keep them and promote them."
- "But I can do much greater good than adding 10% value. I could focus on completely new packages that bring 100 % value."
- "But I created them and took care of them for a long time. People should use them."
- "It's ok, they were good in a time, but things have changed."
- "Ok, maybe I could ask community, what they think about it."


**So I [asked people on Slack and Github](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/162)** what they think about it. Almost everybody (my inner Zen master included)
agreed **to drop them and let Symfony handle that**.
 
I must say, it was much easier to decide after getting such feedback. **Thank you [Filip Prochazka](https://filip-prochazka.com/),
[Tomas Fejfar](https://www.tomasfejfar.cz/),  [Stof](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/issues/161),

[Jachym Tousek](https://github.com/enumag), [Jan Mikes](https://github.com/lexinek)
and [Javier Eguilez](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/162#issuecomment-299441503)**
for help with this.

  
## Letting Package Go

I realized I could let packages go and made few PRs:
 
- [drop DefaultAutowire](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/162#issuecomment-299441503)
- [drop ServiceDefinitionDecorator, AutoServiceRegistration, ControllerAutowire and SymfonyEventDispatcher](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/155) 

That eventually lead to:
 
- [dropping EventDispatcher integration to Nette](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/170)

Don't worry:
 
- **all have better replacement** (I will show you bellow)
- **you can still use them** (they just won't get any updates)


Let's look on each package now:

## [DefaultAutowire](https://github.com/DeprecatedPackages/DefaultAutowire)

This package turned on autowiring by default for most of services.

### Before

All services were autowired.

### After

[Use `_defaults` section](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/#1-let-s-add-code-defaults-code):

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
```

All services in this config will be now autowired. You can use it in any `.yml` file.


## [ServiceDefinitionDecorator](https://github.com/DeprecatedPackages/ServiceDefinitionDecorator)

This packages helped with service tagging and method calls by type.


### Before

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
decorator:
    Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command:
        tags:
            - { name: "console.command" }

    AbstractEntityRepository:
        calls:
            - ["setEntityManager", ["@event_manager"]]
```

### After

Use [`autoconfigure`](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/#2-use-autoconfigure)
and [`_instanceof`](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/#5-use-code-instanceof-code)
features.

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    autoconfigure: true 

    Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command: ~

    _instanceof:
        AbstractEntityRepository:
            calls:
                - ["setEntityManager", ["@event_manager"]]
```

### Minitip

You can also use `@required` annotation instead of `_instanceof` in this case, as **[shared by Kevin Bond](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/#comment-3306767439)** - thank you Kevin!



## [AutoServiceRegistration](https://github.com/DeprecatedPackages/AutoServiceRegistration)

This package helped you to register multiple services at once with Finder.
 
### Before

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
symplify_auto_service_registration:
    directories_to_scan:
        - %kernel.root_dir%
    class_suffixes_to_seek:
        - Controller
```

### After 

Use [PSR-4 based service autodiscovery and registration](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/#4-use-psr-4-based-service-autodiscovery-and-registration).

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml

services:
    App\: # no more manual registration of similar groups of services 
        resource: ../❴Controller,Command,Subscriber❵
```

Tada!

And just like that, you can drop 4 of Symplify bundles and use Symfony 3.3 happily and safely ever after.

That's it for today. In next post, I will show you, **how to deprecate package without letting anyone behind**.
Not even your blog readers that could came across and old post about it.
