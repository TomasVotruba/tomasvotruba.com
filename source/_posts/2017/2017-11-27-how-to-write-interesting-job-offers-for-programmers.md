title: "How to Write Interesting Jobs Offers for Programmers"
perex: '''
    A few years watching the labor market from a position of PHP programmers from the perspective of companies. With both sides have a good relationship. I think what they need and what is bothering you. **I see that they want each other, just communication is little stuck**. 
    <br><br>
Originally from the feedback should be on ads Jobs.cz and Skrz.cz. When reading them but I thought a **lot of other tips, which I want to share**.

@TODO!


## 1.AD is an advertising article, it should look like from a Copywriter

The entire ad is one of seduction. At the end of the candidate must get to bed so that he liked. So that it gives the next morning.
 
## It's not about you - it's about who is looking for you

Plenty ad is written more like a self-presentation of the company - what they do, what is best and what she could. **People read because they want something for themselves** - information, money or entertainment. **What the job will be, looking right at the beginning. Give it to them in the first period!**

### Be honest

Indicate only technology that really have. Not those who plan or want, but you really have to. When you come to interview a man who is looking forward to PHP 7, and you will only deploy begins to feel that cooking water.

**The text must be honest with the reader get what you expect. Only then you will believe and come back to you.**

### Friends with Benefits

**Když u vás pracuje někdo šikovný, zmiňte ho v inzerátu**. Lidé půjdou spíše za kamarádem nebo někým v komunitě známým, než jen do firmy.


When you work with someone cute, mention it in the advertisement . People will go more for a friend or someone in the community known until just firm.

Alone remember these pairs (although some do not work there already):

- Filip Procházka - DámeJídlo.cu, Rohlik.cz
- Ondrej Mirtes - Slevomat.cu
- Patrik Votoček - Shipito.com
- Vašek Purchart - Lavito.cz


### Ask for feedback - inside and out

**1. Tell your feedback on work**

"What ultimately led us to the place of the competition?"

**2. Put it read to someone outside**

Your employees will naturally see better than someone neživíte. People from the outside will give you honest feedback and rather say what they need to establish a relationship.

**3. What two things do you like most and which two would you improve?**

Write 3 people from cílovky. So you have a chance to learn how you operate outside - human eyes, they are looking for.


       
### Strip

Show how you do it really. Evidence place promises.

**You are doing open-source?** Out with him. I know that through, Jobs, Slevomat, PeckaDesign or ShopSys have packages on GitHub. Unfortunately, even in one of the ads I found the link.

For more information, you can only give an insight into the application source code. **Open-source is a very underrated hiring tool.**
    

### Sell your differences 

That's why people go to you, not because you're doing as well as others in PHP, Symfony, Doctrine and Nette.


### Examples attractive differences


I know of companies that:

- **Every month they have a half-day training** - voluntary and optional programmers.

- I know, too , **"each month we have a half-day training"** . But this is a mandatory task elect a director or other departments. There is no greater pain than to be in training "How do marketing Instagram" when I want to learn to scale performance through sharding servers.

- **Give each year 10 000 CZK for education** and can themselves choose how to invest.
- **Every last Friday of the month gives programmers the option to refactor** any part of the code they want.
- **Detach 10 % of work time on personal projects**.

       

### The size and age does not matter

Concepts such as junior and senior to me make no sense. Why?
Imagine that we have two people who are looking for work:

- A. Senior may be a **developer with 10 years of experience**, knows the framework 1, which is taught by himself and does not want to try other, because the one he needs.

- B. Junior may be a **19 year old guy** in front of height, which says that there is no framework written and probably will not be quite good. That can Elastic, Doctrine, net, and begins to see a benefit Symfony (True Story).

**Who would you take?**

Now vemzměte that by ad type the *Senior*. Which one do you log in? People underestimate the programmers, and it pays desetinásob. Think about it.

I mentioned everything I wanted, so now let's look at the specific ads.



## Co zlepšit na Jobs.cz 

<strike>Konkrétně na [tomto inzerátu](http://lmc.jobs.cz/pridej-se-k-nam/detail/?id=G2-1151391350-aden_brand0&rps=186).</strike>

Unfortunately, the add doesn't have a permalink, so it's gone now. Next time, I'll make a screenshot.
 
### Like
@todo fa-icon + 


- And what we will do with us happy? - Great title!

- "Instead of CV we still can only send a link to your profile on LinkedIn" - super, using conventional tools CV! I'm surprised how little I see it.

- Doing open-source focused on testing - somewhere there would Steward threw.

- At work you have a large monitor screen. That would add to the ad. Certainly deliver and make sure that the tests you mean. Elsewhere say the test, but if you want to see tests, somehow not.


### I changed

- When I read 'knowledge of PHP 5, "I think, think 5.3 or 5.6? They have projects in all these versions? I either wrote or just a specific version of PHP.

- Among the "JS frameworks" Angular include 1 and 2, ReactJs jQuery and others. I can Angular need one, but I do not know if it's enough. It may be that you need someone just over 1 Angular, but because it is not written as such a person logs on. I'd rather be listed on that particular wish.

- Anything after "more" has uncertain and unclear. I edited it to clear communication.



## What to improve Skrz.cz

<strike>Specifically for [this ad](https://www.startupjobs.cz/nabidka/5101/senior-php-developer-ka-chces-proniknout-do-automatizace-v-projektu-postavenem-na-symfony)</strike>. Again gone. 

### Like

- I like bold important texts, titles and operates transparently links to attract clicks of.

- Nicely and specifically itemized what I get:

    - "Friday breakfast joint" - yum - to draw a picture and now I have
    - "Fruits, vegetables, coffee and tea freely available :)"
    - "Security, home environment, open access, **open communication**, **space for self-realization** and **education**, where a lot of pride" - a bold body sounds really good, I feel it is expanded. I'd forgotten his own hapiness manager.

### I changed

- The phrase "work hard" has a lot of negative heavy charge and can stain the rest of the ad. Himself by imagining the overtime and hacking personal life. I can work hard when I see the sense in it. **If there is any sense, I would add just behind those words**. If you need to be a *commitment to quality*: "You write better quality code with tests than Bastl technical debt?"

- The first 2/3 of the company until then is "What's behind it." I changed the order and information about the company shortened to half. "What's it worth" is commercially and decisively. I would rather use "What we have for you."

- I eased the reference count in half. There are quite a lot as a programmer and do not know if I broach them, are relevant to the job, or is it just a reference to a product.


## Put at the end

Finally, on 2 advertisements relief that I like.


### PeckaDesign goes naked and still teach you

This advert you will find it on [delejcoumis.cz](http://www.delejcoumis.cz/).

What is the killer? Its [source code is open-source](https://github.com/peckadesign/DelejCoUmis.cz). This will allow me to easily determine what the code level - if I understand him, or if there have something to learn. And [`composer.json`](https://github.com/peckadesign/DelejCoUmis.cz/blob/master/composer.json) I find the technology used.

And this is a **100% advantage against all other ads**:

### LidskáSíla seeks reinforcements

Just yesterday caught my eye <strike>[tento inzerát](https://www.startupjobs.cz/en/offer/3319/php-developer-lidskasila-cz)</strike>.

Color and logos - do not have to decipher the text, **just scan the logos**. It is concise and readable - I have a feeling that with them **will agree to anything and that they appreciate me**.

If your add system allows own color styling, use it.

> "One picture is worth a thousand words."


<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/job-offers/php7.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="PHP 7.1 when stable">


What have you learned from him? I guess that:

- project with the times - PHP 7.1 was released in December 2016
- is there anyone who knows the first stable version is not stable enough because it is not tested in practice


That is my experience collection with PHP job adverts. And what about you?

**What intrigued you, that you are in your current job?**

What ad you took and what? Throw me a link in the comments, I like to blink. Thanks.
