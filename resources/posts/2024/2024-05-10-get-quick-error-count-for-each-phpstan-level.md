title: "Get Quick Error Count for each PHPStan level"
perex: |
    When I come to a new project, I want to make a rough idea what I'm dealing with in few minutes. I usually check `composer.json`, and [measure the lines](/blog/easy-and-quick-way-to-measure-lines-of-code-in-php).

    Then I'd love to run PHPStan and get rough idea of current state. But if there are baselines, custom extensions, global ignores or none PHPStan at all?

     and use PHPStan, it w
@todo
