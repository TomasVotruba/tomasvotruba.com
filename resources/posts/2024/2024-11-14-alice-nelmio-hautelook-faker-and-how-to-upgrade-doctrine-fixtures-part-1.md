title: "Alice, Nelmio, Hautelook, Faker - How to upgrade Doctrine Fixtures - Part 1"
perex: |
    Upgrading Doctrine Fixtures can be challenging work. It requires coordination of four different package groups on Github. One cannot be upgraded without the other.
    <br>
    <br>
    We first prepare for the jump, then take the leap with confidence. I'm writing this post as I handle the upgrade, so my thoughts are fresh and the process is still ongoing. It may evolve based on new information. Let's see where the rabbit hole goes.
---

What is the upgrade plan?

```diff
-hautelook/alice-bundle:^1.*
+hautelook/alice-bundle:^2.*

-nelmio/alice:^2.*
+nelmio/alice:^3.*

-fzaninotto/faker
+fakerphp/faker
```

```diff
-doctrine/data-fixtures:^1.5
+doctrine/data-fixtures:^1.7

-doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle:^3.*
+doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle:^5.*
```

<br>

But first, we have to prepare, to make upgrade smooth as walk in the park.


<br>

## 1. Prepare: Teach Data Fixtures to Give Feedback

Before we start the upgrade itself, we have to [setup fast feedback loop](/blog/2020/01/13/why-is-first-instant-feedback-crucial-to-developers), so we can fix broken code quickly.

To load PHP data fixtures, we run native ODM/ORM bundle command:

```bash
// in ORM
bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

// in ODM
bin/console doctrine:mongodb:fixtures:load
```

This commands find all PHP fixtures, puts them in an order and load them to database.

But there is one ["Volkswagen issue"](https://github.com/hugues-m/phpunit-vw) - what happens if Doctrine fixture throws an error? Command continues **without failing nor any report**.

<br>

Why is that? Both commands run [`AbstractExecutor`](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures/blob/5ee102b61742edd60fb0b80412f38c71761441b1/src/Executor/AbstractExecutor.php#L122) class under the hood, that only report about fixture file loading *has started*:

```php
public function load(ObjectManager $manager, FixtureInterface $fixture)
{
    if ($this->logger) {
        $this->log('loading ' . $prefix . get_class($fixture));
    }

    // ...

    $fixture->load($manager);
    $manager->clear();
}
```

How do we get an error output on fail? The **logger should output something on error**.

<br>

We can add verify this with simple unit test or [a 3-line vendor patch](/blog/2020/07/02/how-to-patch-package-in-vendor-yet-allow-its-updates) applied on `AbstractExecutor`:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ ../lib/Doctrine/Common/DataFixtures/Executor/AbstractExecutor.php
@@ -116,7 +116,12 @@
             $fixture->setReferenceRepository($this->referenceRepository);
         }

-        $fixture->load($manager);
+        try {
+            $fixture->load($manager);
+        } catch (\Throwable $throwable) {
+            $this->log(sprintf(
+                'Error executing "%s" with error: "%s"',
+                get_class($fixture),
+                $throwable->getMessage()
+            );
+        }
+
         $manager->clear();
     }
```

We could print one error and stop the run. But if we have 20 fixture files, we want to run all of them and get all errors at once.

<br>

Great! **Now we get at a feedback in the output, if fixture fails**.
Ideally, this should be in command itself. It should return non-zero code on failure of any called fixture.


<br>

What's the next step to get ready?

<br>

## 2. Prepare: Make Data Fixtures Write-only

Typically, the database fixtures are made-up data, that we put into an empty database. Then we run bunch of tests on it and can throw it away. Data fixture should not interact with database in any way. If we need to connect to database, we [use references](https://symfony.com/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/current/index.html#sharing-objects-between-fixtures).

<br>

References is a simple array with:

* *made up string* => *specific fixture entity*

<em style="font-size: 2em; color: red;">‚ùå</em> &nbsp;  Saying that, there should be no calls in fixtures that read from database:

```php
$promptRepository = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Prompt::class);
$prompt = $promptRepository->get(5);

$this->entityManager->find(Prompt::class, 5);
```

Instead, simple set object by reference, and get it back:

```php
// first fixture class
$this->setReference('prompt-5', $prompt);

// next fixture class that uses first one
$prompt = $this->getReference('prompt-5');
```

**Make sure there are no read calls in your fixtures, otherwise we tangle dependencies together.**
Once we have write-only fixtures, we can run separated CI job that tests that fixtures are loaded properly.

Again, we get **instant feedback** and can iterate quickly.

<br>

But how do we make sure that fixtures are loaded properly in the future as well? What if new developer will join team in a year and will start to fetch data from the database? PHPStan to the rescue!

<br>

We can create a custom `NoRepositoryCallInDataFixtureRule` rule and add it to our `phpstan.neon`:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\FixtureInterface;
use PhpParser\Node;
use PhpParser\Node\Expr\MethodCall;
use PhpParser\Node\Identifier;
use PHPStan\Analyser\Scope;
use PHPStan\Rules\Rule;

final class NoRepositoryCallInDataFixtureRule implements Rule
{
    public function getNodeType(): string
    {
        return MethodCall::class;
    }

    /**
     * @param MethodCall $node
     * @return string[]
     */
    public function processNode(Node $node, Scope $scope): array
    {
        if (! $scope->isInClass()) {
            return [];
        }

        $classReflection = $scope->getClassReflection();
        if (! $classReflection->isSubclassOf(FixtureInterface::class)) {
            return [];
        }

        if (! $node->name instanceof Identifier) {
            return [];
        }

        $methodName = $node->name->toString();
        if (! in_array($methodName, ['getRepository', 'find', 'findAll', 'findBy', 'findOneBy'])) {
            return [];
        }

        return [
            'Data fixtures cannot use repository calls, as they are write only'
        ];
    }
}
```

Now the knowledge is encoded in the codebase, and PHPStan has our back.

<br>

## 3. Prepare: There is PHP and there is YAML

### The PHP Fixtures

I would assume there is single type of test fixture, but that's not the case. There are native Doctrine Fixtures, that are PHP classes that extend `Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\AbstractFixture`.

To run them, we need native package:

```bash
composer require doctrine/data-fixtures --dev
```

And one of bundles:

```bash
composer require doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle --dev
composer require doctrine/doctrine-bundle --dev
```

We load them with single CLI command:

```bash
// in ORM
bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

// in ODM
bin/console doctrine:mongodb:fixtures:load
```

### The YAML fixtures

Now, the next are YAML fixtures, that make use of [nelmio/alice](https://github.com/nelmio/alice):

```bash
composer require nelmio/alice --dev
composer require fzaninotto/faker --dev
```

I personally never understood value of this package, as same can be achieved with native PHP fixtures, but they're sometimes used together. They're handled by separate bundle:

```bash
composer require hautelook/alice-bundle --dev
```

And loaded by a **separate command**:

```bash
bin/console hautelook_alice:doctrine:fixtures:load
```

That means instead of 2 Doctrine-maintained packages, we have 5 to upgrade.

Using these YAML fixtures increase the upgrade price by 4-5 fold without adding much value back.


<br>

These YAML files are missed by  IDE class rename, IDE method rename, there is no support by PHPStan and Rector. This creates bugs, surprises and unnecessary maintenance. To get all benefits above, we simply migrate them [from YAML to PHP](/blog/2020/07/16/10-cool-features-you-get-after-switching-from-yaml-to-php-configs/).

<br>

But let's say we work with PHP and YAML fixtures now.

## 4. Execute: Bump Alice Bundle 1 to 2

The original hautelook/AliceBundle is no longer maintained and [Github repository even returns 404](https://github.com/nelmio/alice/issues/1089). Fortunately there is a replacement - [theofidry/AliceDataFixtures](https://github.com/theofidry/AliceBundle), but the package name remain the same.

What should be do then? Change version in `composer.json`:

```diff
 {
     "require-dev": {
-        "hautelook/alice-bundle": "^1.0"
+        "hautelook/alice-bundle": "^2.0"
     }
 }
```

The fixture command for YAML fixtures can be dropped, as both fixtures anore now handled by first command:

```diff
 bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
-bin/console hautelook_alice:doctrine:fixtures:load
```

## 5. Execute: Bump Nelmio/Alice 2 to 3

Nelmio uses Faker under the hood. But **the Faker package was [sunset in 2020](https://marmelab.com/blog/2020/10/21/sunsetting-faker.html)**. Fortunatelly - we have a replacement package `fakerphp/faker`.

First, let's update the `composer.json`:

```diff
 {
     "require-dev": {
-        "nelmio/alice": "^2.0",
+        "nelmio/alice": "^3.0",
-        "fzaninotto/faker": "^1.0"
+        "fakerphp/faker": "^1.23"
     }
 }
```

<br>

Great! Now we have readonly test fixtures and we've bumped version for 2 out of 5 packages. We've added custom PHPStan rule to have our back and run tests on fixtures to make them loadable.

It's enough work for one run, so we'll continue next time.

<br>

## Follow up and Reflection

Looking at all the work, does this seem like best way to add test fixtures? I'm thinking, how can we make the fixtures easy to maintain in ext 5 years? Instead of having 5 packages to handle, there could be just one. Instead of PHP + YAML mix, there should be just PHP so PHPStan, IDE and Rector can do the hard work for us.

There is also [foundry](https://github.com/zenstruck/foundry) package, that handles fixtures in PHP exclusively way. The team behind it released [Foundry 2 just this summer](https://les-tilleuls.coop/en/blog/foundry-2-is-now-available-new-features-and-migration-path). The syntax is also Laravel-like, so test fixtures are easier to use for more PHP devs.

There is some food for thoughts. Let's see how the upgrade goes.

<br>

Happy coding!
