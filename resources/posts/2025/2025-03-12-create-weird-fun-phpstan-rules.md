title: "Create Weird Fun PHPStan Rules like Nobody's Watching"
perex: |
    There are 2 ways to use PHPStan. Use native levels, official extensions and raise the level from 0 to 8. This is good start, it often requires enormous work and brings must-have value.

    There is also 2nd way: I wanted PHPStan **to be more fun, more tailored to unique projects I work with**. That's why I made [symplify/phpstan-rules](https://github.com/symplify/phpstan-rules) - package that just crossed 6 200 000 downloads. One the most used PHPStan extension apart official ones.

    I put all fun and practical rules there, and often they prove to be useful to others too.

    But today I want you to move from end-user to **a creator**.

Today we write a custom PHPStan rule together. Not for everyone, but only for you and local project. We will not write test, we will not make it 100 % reliable, we will not cover all edge cases. We will just make it bring value, make it fun and practical.

That's real beauty of my own local PHPStan rules - they can be KISS &ndash;Simple & Stupid. I don't have to feel ashamed on socials if they seem too vague or for everyone.

<br>

I work on various codebases, raising [type coverage](/blog/how-to-measure-your-type-coverage) one 1 % at a time. It's lot of manual work or Copilot exchanges I need to verify. In short: repetitive thinking that hurts my brian.

<br>

Last week, I've noticed simple pattern in one of codebases:

```php
public function get($userId): User
{ /* ... */ }

public function run($userId): void
{ /* ... */ }

public function request($userId, array $params): void
{ /* ... */ }
```

<br>

There is type missing for `$userId`... what if we know it's always `int` or `string`?

I've checked other calls in codebase + database and made astounding discovery: **the user id is always an `int`**!

<br>

I wondered: what if we make a PHPStan rule that:

* brings value
* takes 10 minutes to write
* is fun to write

## 10-min Experiment

I often have no idea if PHPStan rule will work or not, so I put 10 mins experiment limit on it. If it doesn't work, I just throw it away. If it does, we keep the rule and improve it.

<br>

Let's dive in!

<br>

## 1. Create PHPStan rule class

First, make a directory:

```bash
/utils/phpstan/src
```

There create an empty `ParamTypeByNameRule.php` class:

```bash
/utils/phpstan/src/ParamTypeByNameRule.php
```

## 2. Autoload in `composer.json`

```bash
{
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Utils\\PHPStan\\": "utils/phpstan/src",
        }
    }
}
```

Refresh PSR-4 paths:

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

## 3. Fun part: write the rule

The boring setup is done, let's write the fun part! What should our PHPStan rule do?

* find a parameter
* check if has a type - yes? skip it
* if not, what is the name of the parameter?
* is it `userId`? suggest an `int`

<br>

Easy-peasy! I think it will be the shortest custom rule ever written.

```php
<?php

namespace Utils\PHPStan;

use PHPStan\Rules\Rule;
use PhpParser\Node\Param;

class ParamTypeByNameRule implements Rule
{
    public function getNodeType(): string
    {
        return Param::class;
    }

    /**
     * @param Param $node
     */
    public function processNode(Node $node, Scope $scope): array
    {
        // we know the type - let's skip it
        if ($node->type !== null) {
            return [];
        }

        // what is parameter name?
        $parameterName = $node->var->name->toString();
        if ($parameterName !== 'userId') {
            return [];
        }

        return [
            RuleErrorBuilder::message('The $userId param is missing `int` type')
                ->identifier('custom.paramTypeByName')
                ->build();
        ];
    }
}
```

That's all folks!

<br>

## 4. Register rule in `phpstan.neon`

```yaml
rules:
    - Utils\PHPStan\ParamTypeByNameRule
```

<br>

*Protip*: try runnig **only this rule alone** without any levels:

```yaml
parameters:
    customRulesetUsed: true

    # comment out level
    # level: 8
```

## 5. RunPHPStan

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan
```

That's it!

<br>

## 6. Improve...

Does it bring value? If yes, improve it. If not, throw it away.

The next step would be to add more param-name&dash; pairs - like `$articleId`, `$groupName` etc.

<br>


This rule was so much fun to write and use, I've turned it into generic one. Raising param type coverage is one the most complex type coverages, and this rule turned it into a fun game that saves times and brain power:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is one of the most weird, laziest and easiest PHPStan rules I&#39;ve ever written... üòÅ<br><br>...and the beauty is, it brings instant real value <br>to any codebase with missing type declarations üòé <a href="https://t.co/4XQTo8ebhV">pic.twitter.com/4XQTo8ebhV</a></p>&mdash; Tomas Votruba (@VotrubaT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/1899775072438501389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2025</a></blockquote>

<br>

## 7. Your turn!

Now it's your turn to make however weird, stupid, simple, non-sense PHPStan rule you want. Don't forget - nobody's watching and you can be creative beyond reason. Can you think it? Write it!

It's your project, your rules, your fun and if it **brings any value, stick with it**.

<br>

Writing custom PHPStan rules is one the greatest assets when it comes to raising codebase value in time. It stays in the project after you leave and helps others to keep the codebase clean and safe.

<br>

Happy coding!
