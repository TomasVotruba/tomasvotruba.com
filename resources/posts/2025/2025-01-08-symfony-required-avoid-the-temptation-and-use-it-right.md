title: "Symfony @required - Avoid the Temptation and Use it Right"
perex: |
    Symfony 3 introduced a [`@required` annotation](https://symfony.com/doc/3.x/service_container/calls.html) (now also an attribute), that allows to inject more services via setter method apart constructor. In that time, it was good.

    The goal was to solve circular dependencies: when A needs B, B needs C and C needs A.

    But more often than not, I see PHP projects where it got completely out of hand.

    How to use it right?

The Symfony docs is not much verbose about *how not to use it*, so this my attempt to fill missing piece. Similar to static methods, it's easy to use everywhere instantly, but very hard to revert the change to clean constructor injection.

<br>

## 3 Temptations to Avoid

## 1. `@Required` is not "a way to get a service"

This annotation was introduced in times of static containers, where we could get a service by using global container,e. g. `$this->get(ServiceWeNeed::class)`.

Let's replace that, shall we?

```php
final class HomepageController
{
    private ProductRepository $productRepository;

    /**
     * @required
     */
    public function setProductRepository(ProductRepository $productRepository)
    {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    // ...
}
```

## üëé

<br>

This is bit too verbose and ugly, isn't it? But it's just one step from second temptation.

<br>

## 2. `@required` is not for "Handy Traits"

If we combine 2 cools features in the way nobody expected them to use, we'll get following:

```php
trait ProductRepositoryTrait
{
    private ProductRepository $productRepository;

    /**
     * @required
     */
    public function setProductRepository(ProductRepository $productRepository)
    {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    // ...
}
```

Now we can finally have 1-line solution to inject any service anywhere:

```php
final class HomepageController
{
    use ProductRepositoryTrait;

    public function home()
    {
        $products = $this->productRepository->fetchAll();
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
final class ProductController
{
    use ProductRepositoryTrait;

    public function list()
    {
        $products = $this->productRepository->fetchAll();
        // ...
    }
}
```

So neat, right? This was especially tempting before PHP 8.0 came with promoted properties.

## üëé

<br>

I've seen this in 3 projects recently and it makes any changes very slow and sticky.

The original idea of `trait` was to **re-use shared and diverse logic in value objects/entities**, to avoid bloated abstract classes.

If we want to use a service anywhere, we inject it via constructor.

<br>

This setter method also opens possibility **to override service from the outside**. You thought this the only `ProductRepository` service instance in whole project? It could be, or maybe not. We're only one tiny step away from next temptation.

<br>

## 3. `@required` is not to make mocking and tests easier

Last but not least, there setters allow us to change service in tests:

```php
final class HomepageControllerTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test(): void
    {
        $homepageController = self::$container->get(HomepageController::class);

        $productRepositoryMock = $this->createMock(ProductRepository::class);
        $productRepositoryMock->expect('find')->willReturn('...');

        $homepageController->setProductRepository($productRepositoryMock);
    }
}
```

So easy, so tempting, right?

## üëé

<br>

This is also wrong, as we **have just turned our dependency injection paradigm into setter injection**.

Next time any other developer in our team will need to mock a service, they will create service setters everywhere.

<br>

Forget all previous examples... so how to use the `@required` correctly?

<br>

## Three Ways to Use it Right

If you can, always use constructor injection:

```php
final readonly class HomepageController
{
    public function __construct(
        private ProductRepository $productRepository
    ) {
    }
}
```
Clean and reliable. We can build trust in our codebase, as it has single `ProductRepository` instance.

<br>

The `@required` annotation should **be the last solution**, if there is no any better way to inject a service.

<br>

## 1. Prevent Circular Dependency

As stated, the original idea that sparked this feature was to prevent circular dependencies. This could happen if there are complex service structures, e.g. `PriceResolved` service that depends on 10 different `PriceModifier` that depend mutually on each other.

## üëç

<br>

**Rule of the thumb**: If Symfony container gives us "circular dependency" exception, and it's not easy to handle this in main service by using `->set($this)` on `foreach` loop, we use `@required`.

<br>

## 2. Prevent Dependency hell with Abstract Class

Let's say we have an abstract controller with couple services useful in the controller itself and all its children:

```php
abstract AbstractProductController
{
    public function __construct(
        private Logger $logger,
        private Security $security,
    ) {
    }

    // ...
}
```

Then we extend this controller and add one more dependency to its own:

```php
final class RestProductController extends AbstractController
{
    public function __construct(
        private EntitySerializer $entitySerializer,
        Logger $logger,
        Security $security,
    ) {
        parent::__construct($logger, $security);
    }
}
```

All this just to get `EntitySerializer` here. Now imagine parent `__construct()` of `AbstractController` will change. We have to update all its children.

<br>

This is where `@required` becomes useful. It a little more verbose, but only in single parent class. There rest of children will become more clean:


```php
abstract AbstractProductController
{
    private Logger $logger;

    private Security $security;

    /**
     * @required
     */
    public function autowireAbstractProductController(
        Logger $logger,
        Security $security,
    ) {
        $this->logger = $logger;
        $this->security = $security;
    }

    // ...
}
```

```php
final class RestProductController extends AbstractController
{
    public function __construct(
        private EntitySerializer $entitySerializer,
    ) {
    }
}
```

## üëç

**Rule of the thumb**: If we use an `abstract` class with couple services, and we need to add one more service to its children, we use `@required`.

<br>

## 3. Make autowire method single and unique

Avoid using multiple `@required` methods in a single class:

```php
abstract class AbstractController
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @required
     */
    public function setLogger(Logger $logger)
    {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    public function setSecurity(Security $security)
    {
        $this->security = $security;
    }
}
```

It might lead to forgotten `@required` annotation above one of method (see the 2nd one), or even mutual override by slightly different type. We've seen both of bugs.

<br>

Use single autowire method to be safe:

```php
abstract class AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @required
     */
    public function autowireAbstractController(...)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## üëç

**Rule of the thumb**: Use single autowire method and name it `autowire` + name of the calls. It prevents `autowire()` method override bugs in case of multiple inheritance.

<br>

## How to spot all these problems?

That's a lot tiny code smells to worry about, right? Are you curious about your project `@required` health check?

PHPStan to the rescue - check these [custom PHPStan rules](https://github.com/symplify/phpstan-rules#3-symfony-specific-rules) that watch our back on our projects:

* `NoRequiredOutsideClassRule`
* `RequiredOnlyInAbstractRule`
* `SingleRequiredMethodRule`

Add them to your `phpstan.neon` and see what `vendor/bin/phsptan` tells you.

Happy coding!
