title: "Moving from Disqus to Twitter to make Know-how Sharing Easier"

perex: |
    Discussion were always important part of my blog. To share know-how with you, my reader, learn something new and look for better solution. Last few years the main "fire chat" place moves from private channels like comments under post, to public ones like Twitter and Reddit.

    This knowledge is spread into too many places and comments often repeat and disolve. Not to mention Disqus has some user-tracking issues. How can we change that?

You can see there are different groups expressing opinions under blog posts here. Disqus attracted users in very start, many years ago, when Twitter and other social networks were one-way sharing channels. This has changed. **Twitter is becoming a public place, to share ideas, give feedback and to learn about new technology or approaches to coding.**

I've been thinking about this for a long time, but wasn't sure the change is worth it. Removing Disqus means loosing old comments with valuable know-ledge, forcing group of people to join Twitter (if any) and changing their habits.

## Occam's Razor

On the other hand, my priority is **to make discussion easy, with no entry level barrier**. The discussion should be in present moment, but visiting Disqus requires extra attention, care and sometimes it takes me week or two to reply all the comments. People don't want to wait that long and they never reply.

We rarely visit single private home to speak with wide group of our friends. **Instead, I like the idea of public places like pubs, coffees, bars or airplanes** (where I'm right now), where you can talk with each other if you want.

Instead, there should be single place:

* to discus various points of view
* to easily upvote ideas you agree with
* to share comment freely without need to login or create another social account
* place without cookie tracking
* place without extra adverts you have to block

Majority of PHP bloggers have removed comments completely and moved to Twitter or other public channels years ago. I'm joning them today.

Twitter seems the right place, I use it daily and reply to you much faster. One less social network to worry about and more focus on what is important - **collective community of PHP developers, cooperating with each other**.

Happy commenting!
