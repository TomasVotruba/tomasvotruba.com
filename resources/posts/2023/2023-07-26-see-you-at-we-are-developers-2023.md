This Thursday I'm going to WeAreDeveloper 2023 with talk "Elevate Your PHPStan Level Effortlessly Using GPT". **It will be my first GPT hands-on talk**, so I'm super excited!

<br>

Do you want to boost your PHPStan level without the hassle of fixing thousands of ignored errors? Come to my talk â†“

<br>

There will be over 10 000+ developers, so I imagine it will be rather crazy event.

**I'll be [speaking Thursday 10:10-10:40](https://worldcongress.app.swapcard.com/event/wearedevelopers-world-congress-2023/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTQyMDEyMQ==)** &ndash; to make sure you reach me, catch me after my talk.

See you there!
